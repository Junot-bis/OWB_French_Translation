[b]War, war never changes.[/b]

Old World Blues is a total overhaul for Hearts of Iron IV: starting in the year 2275 and set in the Fallout universe. Experience the postapocalypse like never before with a dynamic war system that ensures that the AI nations act on their own, respond to aggression, and strike when their opponents are weak. Twenty nine national focus trees—three of which are generic—keep the game exciting as numerous powers contest in a battle to control the Wasteland. With the use of “Historic Focuses”, [b]you[/b] get to decide the path famous Fallout factions took, directing generic nations and changing history as you see fit.

Old World Blues is the definitive Fallout experience for Hearts of Iron IV, a total overhaul that uses its expansive list of changes to make the game a truly new and unforgettable experience. With almost three years of development time and glowing reviews across the board, we assure you: you’re in good hands here. Welcome to the wasteland, friend.

    ABILITY_USE_ARCHIMEDES_II_DESC: "ARCHIMEDES II is an energy-based artillery satellite built by Poseidon Energy under contract from the United States government.\nHaving remained stationary in orbit since the end of the Great War Elijah has recently discovered how to use it to its full potential, letting the owner of HELIOS strike at their foes with spears from the sun itself.\n\nAfter firing it we will need to wait some time for the satellite to collect energy using its on-board solar panels before we can fire it again."

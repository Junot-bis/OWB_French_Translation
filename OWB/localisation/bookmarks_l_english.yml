 OWB_NAME:0 "Old World Blues"
 OWB_DESC:0 "Atomic fire scorched the earth in the year 2077 and humanity has yet to fully recover. Desperate struggles erupt across north america as the sane fight for their lives against hordes of insane and depraved raiders. Monolithic giants such as the New California Republic and Caesars Legion seek to expand their grasp, whilst the technocratic and secretive Brotherhood of Steel scour the ruins others forget. Despite all the chaos, one thing remains certain; war, war never changes."
 NCR_OWB_DESC:0 "Despite the staggering losses at the Battle of Navarro, the NCR achieved victory with the aide of the Brotherhood. Decades later tensions with their former allies are running high, and their army has fallen from grace; becoming a mess of undertrained and underequipped soldiers with no standardisation.\n\nThe bear looks to the east with concern, as reports of Caesar's Legion's rapid growth continue to flood in. To the north the city states grow powerful and the republic debates intervention, while to the south Baja and the Brotherhood continue to be a thorn in the bear's side."
 CES_OWB_DESC:0 "Founded by a group of hostages captured by the Blackfoot Tribe, nobody could have realised how far Caesar would take the tribals under him. Almost two decades later and the Legion is fighting numerous wars of conquest, having absorbed tens of tribes and stripped them of their identities; converting them to Caesar's cult of personality.\n\nThe Legion must consider its options. The White Legs slowly warm to the them, the Hangdogs and Twin Mothers prepare for war, and the NCR observes from a distance. However, Caesar desires the Twisted Hairs as their conquest will bring him closer to Vegas; his Rome."
 BOS_OWB_DESC:0 "Their resounding victory over the Enclave at Navarro gave the Brotherhood much to celebrate, but the following years were punishing. Jeremy Maxson died suddenly, and his successor Jonathan Maxson was killed in action. The next Maxson had been sent east to D.C., and so the Elders were forced to choose one of their own. Mari Törni, a Navarro veteran, was chosen to lead.\n\nBrotherhood operations remain the same: discover tech, steal tech, kill those who disagree. They're expanding their sphere of influence to include the Shi, the Mojave Chapter, and Arroyo. The NCR watches with caution."
 VEG_OWB_DESC:0 "Mr. House founded RobCo before the Great War, and used his wealth to build a machine to sustain his body indefinitely. Awakening late into the new age Mr. House took control over New Vegas, raising the tribes in his casinos up and giving them the gift of civilisation.\n\nMr. House desires to reclaim the platinum chip to activate his Securitrons within the Vault and upgrade their software. Vegas is filled with snakes, and befittingly it has many people who desire to topple the lofty throne of the Lucky 38. Benny, and the King are the main contenders for the top, each with their own motivations."
 EHT_OWB_DESC:0 "Ever since the NCR violently removed the Eighties from Sac-Town they have stalked Utah more vigorously, their hatred for the false republic growing as the years passed. Worshipping the I-80 is deeply rooted into their culture, and they strongly desire to reclaim the road.\n\nWar will soon be upon the Eighties, and their warbikes will roar across the wasteland. There is debate amongst the men as to which glorious conquest to undertake first. Shall they ride to Ruby Valley and finish what they started, reclaim the holy road from Vault City, or sack the decadent casinos of Reno?"
 NCN_OWB_DESC:0 "After the fall of New Jerusalem the mormons were forced to resettle. They founded New Canaan over a period of difficult years, adopting an open and accepting policy for outsiders to avoid repeating the mistakes which ruined their last home.\n\nNew Canaan regularly sends missionaries out to preach the word of God, saying that any man who is baptised may live within their walls as one of their own. They regularly commune with the tribes of Utah, offering the bible, food, and communal help. New Canaan is generally well liked in Utah and treated warmly by most tribes."
 DES_OWB_DESC:0 "Prewar survival tactics proved incredibly effective when employed by proper survivalists. The Desert Rangers strive to protect the innocent from raiders, guarding weaker communities and caravans.\n\nRanger leadership is divided on the direction of their organisation. Some believe that siding with the Brotherhood will serve their goals, others wish to petition the NCR for the protection of Nevada; whilst Snake Vargas is determined to go it alone. All parties agree that their current priorities are to crush the Vipers, and the Jackals, in order to keep the locals safe."
 VLT_OWB_DESC:0 "Surrounded by seemingly endless desert, Vault City is an oasis amongst the suffering wastes. Despite its beautiful appearance, the city is a corrupt pit of ethnocentric elitism and narcissism. Vault City is the most medically advanced faction in the wasteland, capable of cloning limbs and treating injuries that would be untreatable to others - but this knowledge remains sealed behind their walls.\n\nThe former inhabitants of Vault 8 stand at a precipice where they must decide the future of their city state. Whether they continue to spread their name in infamy remains to be seen."
 TRL_OWB_DESC:0 "Within the dark depths of a cave system in Oregon, the denizens of Troll Warren drag screaming victims into a lagoon of FEV. A former dumping ground for Mariposa Military Base, the remote caverns of the Warren are now home to tribal killers.\n\nAs the distant sound of the world ending echoed from outside, a Mariposa guard fell into the glowing lake, and emerged as the First. Old holotapes in a foreign voice remind him of his lost humanity, but they couldn't prevent his mind from slowly deteriorating. Soon the Warren will awaken, and all of Oregon will tremble."
 WBH_OWB_DESC:0 "Eternal winter shrouds the north of America, and within the blizzard a danger watches silently. Seattle is haunted by ghosts, the castoffs of the Midwest, who vengefully stalk the ruins.\n\nElder Immortal lead his few followers to Seattle hoping to found a new chapter - but his violent tactics and the dire situation turned the chapter into a monster. Violence, enslavement, and conscription have all become core tenants of a dark 'Neo Brotherhood' doctrine. The thick snowfall of Seattle is the perfect backdrop for abductions, murder, and the subjugation of the few who remain."
 WHT_OWB_DESC:0 "Roaming the east of Utah, the White Legs travel and consume in order to sustain themselves. Nomadic savages whose ancestors were lucky to survive the apocalypse, the only culture they know is one stained with blood.\n\nSalt-Upon-Wounds is a mighty warrior and the head of the White Legs tribe. He has lead them to many victories, and now he intends to lead them to glory. Rumors of a mighty empire to the south that spans from Arizona to Colorado call the White Legs to a new destiny - a destiny that will see them as the horns of a great brass bull. "
 NEW_OWB_DESC:0 "Reno is known for little more than the stench of sex and jet fumes. Its dubious abodes are packed full of scum, all crowded around games of dice, cards, and women. Alcohol is the blood that runs through the veins of Reno's denizens.\n\nFour families battle for influence within the city and its surroundings. Salvatore, Wright, Bishop, and Mordino - each family has its own goals for the city, but only one can prevail. Outside Reno's territory the Yakuza attempt to expand what little influence they can find, but their days are numbered."
 ARR_OWB_DESC:0 "Arroyo is a nation of unity: tribals and vault dwellers joining to form a civilised society in the north. With the aid of the 'holy' Garden of Eden Creation Kit, New Arroyo has become the most prosperous and beautiful city in the wasteland.\n\nThe Chosen One assumed the role of Elder after saving their people, and in the decades since has devoted their life to cultivating and protecting the precious hope of their people. Arroyo has remained untouched since 2242, but the winds of change rustle the leaves of the forests of New Arroyo."
 HAN_OWB_DESC:0 "Old world cities are frequented by scavengers and vagabonds for their precious salvage, but only the foolish or desperate would seek to plunder Dog-City. The Hangdogs dominate the towering skyscrapers of Dog-City, watching the packs of feral dogs that stalk the streets below - training their own hounds in the art of war.\n\nWith the Legion on a rapid campaign of conquest and integration, the Hangdogs cautiously watch the south as they await the arrival of the Bull. Soon, Bull and Hound will lock horn and jaw in a battle set to define Colorado for years to come."
 WHD_OWB_DESC:0 "Life within the borders of the Hangdogs territory can be difficult, especially if you're \"abnormal\" in some shape or form. Deeply suspicious of outsiders and mutants, the Hangdogs regularly drive ghouls out of their territory, and deny them entry to their settlements.\n\nGhouls go where ghouls are, hoping to find respite from prejudice with their own kind. As such, when a ghoul settlement was established north of the Hangdogs, most ghouls who were ejected from their territory simply moved north. For many, a difficult is life is better than a life of segregation, even if your leader is a 'Withered Dog'."
 HEA_OWB_DESC:0 "Originally a peaceful Christian nation founded by a pastor and his congregation, Heaven's Gate has become an imposing juggernaut of military might and zealous belief in God. Its industry is almost entirely powered by steam cores, miniaturized steam generators small enough to be carried in the palm of your hand.\n\nThe Innocence Lost Massacre changed the way Heaven's Gate looked at outsiders forever. Saint Michael's rise to power only furthered the radicalisation of the clergy, and the cracks are beginning to show. Soon, all outsiders will be sinners in the eyes of the Lord."
 MOJ_OWB_DESC:0 "Founded by Father Elijah, a scribe who miraculously became an Elder within the Brotherhood, the Mojave Chapter was established for an expedition into the Mojave Desert. Despite optimistic early prospects, their results were lacking, which frustrated Elijah greatly.\n\nGrasping at the wasteland from their stronghold in Hidden Valley, the Mojave Chapter prepares to send numerous manned expeditions across the wasteland, at Elijah's frantic request. He dreams of the Old World, and of harnessing the power of the sun. Whether or not his subordinates share his vision remains to be seen."
 BRK_OWB_DESC:0 "§YFor the seasoned wastelander§!. Frigid outcroppings of stone and shattered prewar vessels compliment the twisted nature of the Broken Coast well, its shoreline dotted with miniature tragedies. Life along the coast is hard, and raiding is all the people there know. To them, violence is life itself.\n\nThe ancestors of the current pirates of the Broken Coast endured The Great Blizzard, an event immediately following the Great War, that blocked out the sky and killed untold thousands. Survival is in their blood. When settlers spot raiders from the Broken Coast, they don't fight: they run."
 OTHER_OWB_DESC:0 "The Great War plunged the world into seemingly eternal darkness and threw everything into chaos. People struggled to survive and over the decades the survivors banded into larger and larger groups.\n\nSettlers continue on in an attempt to retain the morals of the old world. Tribals stalk the lands of their ancestors, hunting and avoiding the technology left behind by the old world. Raiders continue to dominate the wasteland, killing, pillaging, and burning. Resources are scarce and the numerous communities of the wasteland are always struggling to survive."

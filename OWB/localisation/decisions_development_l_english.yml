  development_project_decisions_wtt_desc: "Old Pre-war sites, special locations that could hold promising resources and all other kinds of interesting things to spend resources on. §HThe outcomes of these decisions are influenced by researched technologies.§!"

  development_project_rancho_seco_npp: "Restore the Rancho Seco NGS"
  development_project_rancho_seco_npp_desc: "First conceptualized in the 1960s, the Rancho Seco Nuclear Generating Station was planned to be a major source of power for various counties in California, but was hastily shut down after nuclear disaster proved to be a risk. The station's construction, as well as the measures taken to secure it after its decommission, would make it difficult to restore, though the benefits of doing so would be great.\n"
  development_project_san_onofre_npp: "Restore the SONGS"
  development_project_san_onofre_npp_desc: "The San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station, shortened as SONGS, was both a testament to America's ambition, and an embarrassment for all those involved. Though grandiose in appearance and conception, the station's construction is pockmarked with various signs of inelegance and cut corners. Among these are winding pipes that lead to seemingly nowhere, reactors installed improperly or even backwards, and the occasional leak of toxic material. All the same, the station may be of use to us.\n"
  development_project_diablo_canyon_npp: "Restore the Diablo Canyon Power Plant"
  development_project_diablo_canyon_npp_desc: "The titan of California's pre-war power generation, the Diablo Canyon Power Plant still cuts an imposing figure long after its service to America ended. A 900 acre span of land right on the western shore, the power plant is grand in size and design, though time and seismic activity have left it sporting hopefully negligible scars. Hopefully, we may use it in the way those before us did.\n"
  development_project_satsop_npp: "Restore the Satsop NPP"
  development_project_satsop_npp_desc: "The Satsop Nuclear Power Plant came into the world a grand plan, one which stood unfulfilled by the time the bombs dropped. First commissioned by the WPPSS (the Whoops!), the plant was meant to consist of five large plants designed to supply the vast majority of Washington's energy demand. When the Great War broke out, only two of the five had been constructed, though these two plants were built to last, and could pay dividends if restored.\n"
  development_project_palo_verde_npp: "Restore the Palo Verde NGS"
  development_project_palo_verde_npp_desc: "Before the war, the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station was known to be the most productive nuclear power plant in the US, producing 3.3 gigawatts of electricity on average. The Palo Verde Station was quite unique in the fact that it was integrated into the surrounding infrastructure, utilizing sewage in order to run. Though it may take some ingenuity to operate in any capacity, we could stand to supply a vast swathe of our demand if we manage. The smell is just a feature.\n"
  development_project_first_solar_spp: "Scavenge the First Solar Stockpiles"
  development_project_first_solar_spp_desc: "Though nuclear power was dominant from its discovery all the way to the end of the modern world, it was not the sole source of electricity. Solar power, while initially crude, was popular enough for various companies to invest heavily into it. Among them is First Solar, a company whose stockpile of solar panels have gone unnoticed and unexploited since the dropping of the bombs. A mere investment of learned labour would be sufficient to install and make use of these panels.\n"
  development_project_crecent_dunes_spp: "Restore the Crescent Dunes Project"
  development_project_crecent_dunes_spp_desc: "Even though HELIOS One is known to many as a near-mythical source of power for the Mojave Wasteland, its not the only one of its kind in Nevada. The Crescent Dunes Solar Energy Project, though not as grand or efficient as HELIOS One, stands to be a major source of energy for anyone able to hold and operate it. It would be wise to invest into the project's operation.\n"
  development_project_mountain_home_afb: "Restore the Mountain Home Air Force Base"
  development_project_mountain_home_afb_desc: "Made treacherous by the dropping of the bombs, the Northwest Commonwealth served as the American staging ground for much of the Sino-American War, particularly for battles waged in Alaska. From this, it is easy to infer that a great deal of pre-war materiel is stashed away in the region, particularly in Mountain Home Air Force Base. Clearing the base of debris and making use of the site and its equipment should be prioritized.\n"
  development_project_el_centro_afb: "Restore the NAF El Centro"
  development_project_el_centro_afb_desc: "Right on the border of California and Mexico is the Naval Air Facility El Centro, an American installation that served various purposes throughout America's pre-war history. In times of conflict, the facility was a staging ground for naval air operations on the west coast. In peace, an almost propagandistic projection of American force. The stores of pre-war equipment, as well as the strategic value of the installation, are not to be ignored.\n"
  development_project_whidbey_island_afb: "Restore the NASWI"
  development_project_whidbey_island_afb_desc: "Located at the very tip of the Northwest Commonwealth is the Naval Air Station Whidbey Island, a good-sized military installation which served various purposes up until the Great War. Like many other installations in the area, the NASWI was a valuable staging ground for the war in Alaska, and retains much of its old equipment from when soldiers bustled about the island.\n"
  development_project_beale_afb: "Restore the Beale Air Force Base"
  development_project_beale_afb_desc: "Remarkable in scale and scope, the Beale Air Force base served a great many purposes throughout pre-war history, named after a similarly grand figure from American history. A 23,000 acre swathe of land, the base was once host to a mass amount of soldiers and materiel, and even long after the Great War, hidden caches and resource-rich land still remain.\n"
  development_project_fairchild_afb: "Restore the Fairchild Air Force Base"
  development_project_fairchild_afb_desc: "Like similar bases in the Northwest Commonwealth, the Fairchild Air Force Base was a vital military emplacement throughout the Sino-American war, albeit one with a much shorter and rockier history than most. As the Battle of Anchorage began in earnest, the Chinese sought to attack America from behind their lines, staging a coup out of Fairchild. Much of the equipment abandoned during the fighting can still be found where it was dropped, much in usable or re-storable condition.\n"

If it wasn't for Scarlet stopping him he might have been able to transform all of the wasteland into his hellish tropical paradise.\nIn recent years, while the majority of the mutation around the bombed out shell of Corpus Christi - where the final battle between Scarlet and Reese took place - has been cleaned out there is still the matter of the G.E.C.K. itself.\nWe were never able to destroy it, thus - Scarlet brought it to a secluded place known as Eden and with a small contingent of Brotherhood scouts have gone into isolation as they seek to prevent the G.E.C.K.'s influence from corrupting anything else."

Instead most of them withered in the combat armour they were wearing, being transformed by the radiation over many weeks into intelligent ghouls. While they would recover some for of cohesion far too late to help in the immediate aftermath of the blast, the ghouls were filled with a new purpose: defending that which they held.

As a result the Honduran government had time, if only a little, to prepare for the coming nuclear winter. Binding the military, civil service and emergency services tightly together, Honduras turned into something of a People's Militia. They suffered under the harsh years of radiation storms and nuclear snow, but less so than many others did across the globe. This was fortunate indeed, because less than half a century after the Great War the Hondurans would find themselves under attack from Central America. It appears other Central and Southern American nations were not so fortunate in their preparations, and had fallen into raider-driven anarchy. Periodically, these groups try and launch massed invasions of Honduras with the intent of pushing on to remnants of Mexico and America. Honduras has made it her duty to ensure they do not make it."

Initially the Wardens clashed with the Brotherhood Exiles in Fort Willamette, but the two groups quickly realised they shared many common foes: especially after the Warden's loss of Downtown Portland to Port Maw slavers mere moths prior.

For the first decade the effects were unnoticable, but over time a significant minority of the Vault Dwellers slowly mutated into intelliigent ghouls. Those Dwellers who remained 'pure' grew horrified of their irradiated kin, and before long civil war broke out in the Vault. The ghouls gained the upper hand when they seized control of the Overseer's armoury, forcing the human faction to make their escape to the surface and flee east.

Many of these personelle were assigned positions in Vault 100 by the US Government, who deemed their skills vital to the rebuilding of America after a nuclear conflict.

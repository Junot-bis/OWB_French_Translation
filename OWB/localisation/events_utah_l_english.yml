  nf_utah.1.t: "Our Origins"
  nf_utah.1.desc: "In the ashes of the Old World, our only salvation was each other. As the centuries passed and humanity remade itself, our people were brought together and united by one common factor."
  nf_utah.1.a: "Our faith in the lord our god."
  nf_utah.1.b: "The unity of our tribe."

  nf_utah.2.t: "The New Gods"
  nf_utah.2.desc: "The blast wave slew the Old Gods, and even their memory would be lost as the fallout settled, but not every memory of the past was discarded, New Gods would be born from the rubble, and our people would find new purpose in their sanctification."
  nf_utah.2.a: "The Father, who showed us the way."
  nf_utah.2.b: "The War-Road, that gives all glory."

  nf_utah.3.t: "Our Path"
  nf_utah.3.desc: "As the final aftershocks of the end settle, the path our people must walk becomes clear. Two roads stretch out before, one, of isolation, shunning the outside world and all its horrors, the other, one of great risk, facing the new world head on, and daring to stand against its evils. What path shall our people walk?"
  nf_utah.3.a: "The Path of Inward Perfection"
  nf_utah.3.b: "The Path of Outward Expansion"

  nf_utah.10.b: "Their loyalty should be rewarded."

  nf_utah.11.t: "The White Legs Response"
  nf_utah.11.desc: "Despite our years of loyalty and service, the white legs have betrayed us in the last hour, rather than view us as brothers, they have used us as tools for their dirty work, and have now cast us aside."
  nf_utah.11.a: "To be expected from such brutes."

  nf_utah.20.b: "They need to learn their place."

  nf_utah.21.t: "The Legion Refuses"

  nf_pantheon.10.t: "Eclipse!"
  nf_pantheon.10.desc: "Hysteria grips our devout, the faithful huddle in fear, all that is unholy walks freely. The sun has disappeared, leaving only a hollow shell in its wake. While our tribal legends have reported this calamity happening in the past, no fireside story could prepare us for the terror that the absence of Sol's light has caused to our people. We must act quickly before panic destroys us all."

  nf_pantheon.11.t: "Hiding from Sol"
  nf_pantheon.11.desc: "Reports have come to us of individuals attempting to hide from Sol's divine light. They skulk in the shadows and revel in the dusk, in a manner most perverse to our holy teachings. While they claim they are just resting from the heat of the sun, there can be no doubt that these are heretics in our midst."
  nf_pantheon.11.a: "It's not a sin to shade your eyes."
  nf_pantheon.11.b: "Punish these profligates."

  nf_pantheon.12.t: "False Lights"
  nf_pantheon.12.desc: "Questions have been raised amongst our most devout concerning the manner of false lights. While the ancients held many ways of harnessing and capturing the light, there are many who believe this practice to be heretical, and that only true light from the heavens should be permitted. Should we accept the false light as holy, or banish it from our lands?"
  nf_pantheon.12.a: "Only the sun brings true light."
  nf_pantheon.12.b: "All light is holy."

  nf_pantheon.20.t: "Heavenly Discoveries"
  nf_pantheon.20.desc: "Star-watching is not only a holy duty to Luna, it is also a bounty of untapped discoveries on the procession of the heavens. The latest of which involves one of our nearest sister-planets. Our star-watchers have reported smaller daughters dancing in tandem much in the same way that Luna proceeds us. Is it possible that there could be more than one moon in our procession?"
  nf_pantheon.20.a: "Heresy! There is only one Luna."
  nf_pantheon.20.b: "Celebrate these discoveries!"

  nf_pantheon.21.t: "A New Moon"
  nf_pantheon.21.desc: "The procession carries on throughout all of life. Luna, having completed her descent, has started her slumber, while disconcerting to some of our devout, we rest assured that in all things, Luna will rise again, and the procession will continue."
  nf_pantheon.21.a: "In death, life."

  nf_pantheon.22.t: "A Full Moon"
  nf_pantheon.22.desc: "The procession brings all things to their zenith and their fall. Luna, having reached her apex, has begun her slow descent from the heavens. While our followers rejoice at the glorious light she brings, it is touched with the knowledge that this light must wane before the procession will continue."
  nf_pantheon.22.a: "In life, death."

  nf_pantheon.30.t: "Disastrous Harvest!"
  nf_pantheon.30.desc: "Something terrible has happened to our crops this harvest. fields lie barren, leaves wilt on the stem, fruits rot on the vine. Whilst the greater populace has yet to find out the severity of the problem, we must act quickly or we will have a disastrous famine on our hand."
  nf_pantheon.30.a: "Offer sacrifices to appease the earth!"
  nf_pantheon.30.b: "Divert our remaining food stores to rationing."

  nf_pantheon.31.t: "Bountiful Harvest!"
  nf_pantheon.31.desc: "A miracle has graced us this harvest season. Fruits the size of brahmin and crops swaying higher than a deathclaw. The amount of food we have gathered has far exceeded any ability we have to store it, what should we do with the excess?"
  nf_pantheon.31.a: "We must return our bounty to the soil."
  nf_pantheon.31.b: "We shall share this bounty amongst our people."

  nf_pantheon.32.t: "New Crops?"
  nf_pantheon.32.desc: "The caring for the land is one of solemn duty to our people, and is built on holy tradition and ancient ritual. Despite this, our farmers have requested that new crops be sewn in our fields for the following season, replacing our traditional staples. The farmers claim this will help rejuvenate the soil, but it would be a clear sacrilege of our holy rights. What should we do?"
  nf_pantheon.32.a: "Our traditional crops are what is right for the land."
  nf_pantheon.32.b: "Perhaps a change of diet might be good."

  nf_pantheon.40.t: "Guarding the Holy Sites"
  nf_pantheon.40.desc: "Mesa is old, and age weighs heavily upon it. As the years go by and the faithful continue their pilgrimages, pebble by pebble, the mountain crumbles. While it would certainly be an unpopular move amongst our people, for the good of the mountain, we may need to consider restricting access from the unworthy."
  nf_pantheon.40.a: "All faithful should have access."
  nf_pantheon.40.b: "Only the worthy may enter."

  nf_pantheon.41.t: "A Wealthy Tribe Member"
  nf_pantheon.41.desc: "It has been revealed that one of our people has committed the grievous sin of wealth. Though they tried to hide it well, their home is filled with gaudy baubles and disgusting non-essentials, a filth-ridden profanity to the austerity of our great mountain. There is no question that these possessions must be dealt with, but how should we dispose of these riches."
  nf_pantheon.41.a: "Give his wealth to the people."
  nf_pantheon.41.b: "Give his wealth to the mountain."

  nf_pantheon.42.t: "The Sin of Prosperity"
  nf_pantheon.42.desc: "Things are good. Too good in fact. So good that they are, without a doubt, actually bad. This unmitigated prosperity will only lead to weakness and idle behaviours amongst our people, we must instil the teachings of the mountain to them before their sloth becomes their undoing."
  nf_pantheon.42.a: "We must encourage moderation."
  nf_pantheon.42.b: "We must promote hardship."

  nf_pantheon.70.t: "The Father's Gifts"
  nf_pantheon.70.desc: "Even now, after so many years, the Father still watches over us. A weapons cache bearing the Father's mark, hidden deep in old world wreckage, has been unearthed. While the weapons are a no small gift, the knowledge that we are so well cared for is the greatest gift we could ever be given."
  nf_pantheon.70.a: "We will use these as he would want."

  nf_pantheon.71.t: "The Father's Teachings"
  nf_pantheon.71.desc: "The Father taught us many things, so many that it's hard to keep track of what should take priority. Members of our community have begun to argue that the father demands preparation and survival over all, while an equally vocal group have insisted that the father valued community and interdependence above all else. Which of his teaching's should we embrace?"
  nf_pantheon.71.a: "Embrace Survivalism."
  nf_pantheon.71.b: "Embrace Interdependence."

  nf_pantheon.72.t: "Trespassers in the Cave!"
  nf_pantheon.72.desc: "Reports from one of our bordering shrines have come in, detailing a band of foreigners who have attempted to breach on of the Father's caves. While no one has survived the wrath the father rains on those who trespass, there are worries that their presence may profane the holy place regardless. How should we respond?"
  nf_pantheon.72.a: "The father will deal with them."
  nf_pantheon.72.b: "Stop them before they go too far!"

  nf_pantheon.80.t: "New Tactics?"
  nf_pantheon.80.desc: "Our War-council has convened a new meeting to discuss the art of war. A new member of the council is advocating for a reform to our battle formations, arguing for a rigid formation that can envelop the enemy over our traditional free-form melee. To restrain our warriors from the heat of battle in such a way will no doubt be unpopular, but the benefits of a proper battle strategy may grant us as-yet unattainable victories."
  nf_pantheon.80.a: "All that matters is the battle."
  nf_pantheon.80.b: "A well planned victory is still a victory."

  nf_pantheon.81.t: "War-Weariness"
  nf_pantheon.81.desc: "Not all are strong enough to travel the War-road, but all must try. Some of the more compassionate members of our society ask that we rest from our continual struggle for the moment, so that the wounded among us may tend their wounds and that we may recoup our losses."
  nf_pantheon.81.a: "There must be peace before war."
  nf_pantheon.81.b: "Let them rest when they are dead."

  nf_pantheon.82.t: "A Cowardly General"
  nf_pantheon.82.desc: "A decisive victory on the War-road was achieved today, but at a terrible cost. The leading commander in the field, rather than face the enemy head-on, retreated, leading the foe into a trap which utterly decimated them. While the victory was glorious, there can be no ignoring the fact that the general shirked from a head-first battle. Such an act of cowardice cannot be let off lightly."
  nf_pantheon.82.a: "He can no longer lead us."
  nf_pantheon.82.b: "He has earned our trust in this."


  nf_pantheon.90.t: "Can We Forgive?"
  nf_pantheon.90.desc: "From across the Colorado and Utah, the Dead Horses are a beacon for those who have been cast from their societies. Amongst these refugees, many have come to shed their past sins, and live a new life amongst us. But can all sins be forgiven? Or are some trespasses too great for even God to forgive."
  nf_pantheon.90.a: "There must always be forgiveness."
  nf_pantheon.90.b: "We are God's judgement."

  nf_pantheon.91.t: "Mormon Influence"
  nf_pantheon.91.desc: "The Mormons have often travelled to our lands, offering supplies and teachings to whoever would hear them preach. Lately, however, their missionaries more forceful as of late, preaching of apocalypse and oncoming doom wherever they can be heard. While we respect the Burned Man's people, they are slowly becoming a public nuisance."
  nf_pantheon.91.a: "Welcome them."
  nf_pantheon.91.b: "Politely ask them to leave."

  nf_pantheon.92.t: "Legion Influence"
  nf_pantheon.92.desc: "Frumentarii from the legion have often travelled across the river to visit us, offering riches and weapons to any who would join the cause of Mars. This time though, their recruitment has bordered on press-ganging, intimidating young men to join and threatening violence on those who don't. This disruptive influence has to be managed."
  nf_pantheon.92.a: "Welcome them."
  nf_pantheon.92.b: "Remove them from our people."

  nf_pantheon.100.t: "Explosions!"

  nf_pantheon.100.a: "We must answer this call!"
  nf_pantheon.100.b: "We must outdo this call!"

  nf_pantheon.101.t: "Tumultuous Rain"
  nf_pantheon.101.desc: "Disgusting serenity, choking downpour. The very heavens work against us! Fires quenched, explosions quaffed, all is damp and despair. "
  nf_pantheon.101.b: "Even water must burn one day."

  nf_pantheon.102.t: "A New Flame Design?"
  nf_pantheon.102.desc: "A harness for destruction. Vessel of immolation, transformed? Heresy or high-powered destruction. Progress or purity. The flame calls so brightly, burning in the minds eye."
  nf_pantheon.102.a: "A greater flame brings glory to us all."
  nf_pantheon.102.b: "There can be no progress, only destruction."

  nf_pantheon.110.t: "Harnessing the Wind"
  nf_pantheon.110.desc: "In the time before time, the long-gone ancients were sky-masters of the wind. Not only to fly, but to harness the life of Zephyr, and place its essence in all manner of old-world relics. This essence could be ours, if we too leash the wind."
  nf_pantheon.110.a: "A wind captured is no longer free."
  nf_pantheon.110.b: "A wind harnessed will let us fly even higher."

  nf_pantheon.111.t: "Storm-Flying"
  nf_pantheon.111.desc: "Thunder cracks! Lightning Roars! Zephyr barrels through the storm, calling the reckless and the brave. Do we dare to defy the rage of heaven, to laugh as the wind does at all calamity?"

  nf_pantheon.120.t: "Open Attacks"

While it would be painful, for the good our people we must consider fighting in the open when necessary."

  nf_utah.181.desc:0 "The relationship between Highchapel and the Anointed has been a cause for concern amongst our people. This concern has risen markedly following a message from Highchapel, requesting that we attend a new council mediated by them, in an attempt to mend the schism. Many of our people suspect a trap, but this could be our only way of peaceful unification."
  nf_utah.181.a:0 "We will never reunite with those apostates."
  nf_utah.181.b:0 "If this will bring unity, we accept."

  nf_utah.183.desc:0 "In the year of our lord [ROOT.GetYear], a council of all the Lord's people have gathered, to mend the Schism of the Souls and to bring unity to the faithful. The Murtaugh Schismatics stand firm in their doctrine of soular immutability, and while agreeing to negotiate on the doctrinal matters of conversion and baptism, refuse to accept the orthodox position of soular Anointment. After a week of deliberation and theological pontification, the verdict of the council has been reached:"
  nf_utah.183.a:0 "Their reforms are reasonable, we accept."

  nf_utah.186.a:0 "Praise the Lord!"

  nf_utah.187.t:0 "Highchapel Refuses!"
  nf_utah.187.desc:0 "Despite all our sacrifices in fighting the steam-worshippers, Highchapel has abandoned us in favour of the schismatics, this betrayal is a shock to all our people, who had begun to view the baptisers not just as allies, but as true brothers in Christ."
  nf_utah.187.a:0 "Then they are heretics as well."

  nf_utah.189.a:0 "We shall stand up and look at what's come for us."

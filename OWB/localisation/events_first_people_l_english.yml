  nf_event_fp.5.t: "A Tough Decision"
  nf_event_fp.5.d: "The raider gang holed up in the PIT transformed the erstwhile place of learning into a maze of traps. Coupled with them being heavily armed this means while we could take them out, we would not be able to do so without heavy losses. We could try to reason with them, but this is not guaranteed to succeed either, because raiders rarely listen to reason. Also this may lead to them being aware of our designs for the place and dig in even deeper. Whatever we do, everyone needs to pitch in and we need a group decision of how to progress from here."

  nf_event_fp.6.t: "We send in the Troops"
  nf_event_fp.6.d: "After a lot of back and forth discussion if we should send troops or not the decision was reached to expel the raiders by force. Since this was a mission with a high chance of stepping on a mine, or catching a bullet a volunteer call was started among troops of all three nations with a promise of double pay for anyone signing up for it. Despite the expected deadliness a sizeable number of soldiers signed up. If that was because of their sense of duty, recklessness or greed is hard to tell. \n\nThe actual battle was rather uneventful as far as battles go. The first couple unlucky soldiers stumbled into a few traps, but afterwards our people became more careful in their approach. This is not to say that no more lives were lost after that point, but slow and steady progress was made.\n\nThe self proclaimed Lord of the Pit was waiting for us in a laboratory in the lower floor that was repurposed into something akin to a throne room. He started monologuing about his destiny being to rule over the great plains, when one of our soldiers ended that destiny early with a well aimed bullet to his head. \n\nThe 'Lord' amassed quite a decent amount of caps and other valuables in his throne room that may make this mission worthwhile above the inherent use of the PIT. Also the soldiers learned a couple of lessons on how to survive situations like this, either by their own actions or the misfortune of those not returning."

  nf_event_fp.7.t: "We try to negotiate"
  nf_event_fp.7.d: "Sending in our troops just to die to makeshift explosives and hidden spike traps does not seem like a good way of solving this issue. Especially if we can do it without loss of life. Maybe if we extend the same courtesy, that of not losing their lives, to the Lord of the Pit and his goons we can come to an agreement that satisfies both parties.\n\nApproaching with a small team of negotiators showing a white flag, in the hopes that the raiders knew what that means was the tensest moment of the whole operation. Surprisingly enough, they were not immediately shot. We actually managed to get a parley started. This led to the Lord of the Pit and his men giving up the PIT to us, as long as we promised them no repercussions for anything they did while being in the raiding business and a permanent place in our ranks. This actually may benefit us in the long run in different ways. More people capable of handling weapons is always good. Also, while crude, their defences showed an impressive level of ingenuity, which we surely can apply to other construction efforts. And the Lord of the Pit himself is a capable leader managing to keep a raider gang together for multiple years."

  nf_event_fp.200.t: "Visions of an Unknown Woman"
  nf_event_fp.200.d: "We received a report that last night two hunters received what they called 'a vision'. \nAfter a rather unsuccessful hunt they were prepared to head home when they heard strange noises seemingly coming from everywhere. Looking for the source of that noise they spotted a woman that suddenly appeared 'like an illuminated shadow' a few dozen meters away from them. She was wearing loose robes and was carrying bundles of grain. Cautiously the hunters approached her. Before they could get too close she only said the words \"Come to me again.\", pointing westward. At this point a map appeared next to her in thin air, looking similarly ethereal to her. The hunters said they were certain that it showed a location at the end of the Arkansas River. Then the woman disappeared again in a flash of light. The hunters ran back to their base as fast as they could to report what they have seen.\n\nThere has already been a lot of discussion what this 'vision' means. The Choctaw story keepers say that this event bears a striking resemblance to one of our ancient legends. The Cherokee Council of Scientists and Engineers says the 'vision' could be reasonably easily achievable giving the right technical know-how and resources. But all of this means that someone went to great lengths to bring this message to us. Too much effort for this to be a simple trap. Even if it would be somewhat of an undertaking to make the trip, chances are the result will be worthwhile, even if just to satisfy our curiosity."

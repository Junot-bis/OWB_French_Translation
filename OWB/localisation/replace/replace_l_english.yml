 # Infantry Equipment
  infantry_equipment_1: "Pipe Guns"
  infantry_equipment_1_short: "Pipe Guns"
  infantry_equipment_1_desc: "Arming our troops with bolt-action pipe pistols is all we can do as of now for infantry equipment. While the cartridge fired is somewhat effective, cycling the bolt is a slow process. New equipment is to be developped urgently"

 # Support Equipment

  support_equipment_1_desc: "Assorted things and gadgets used to communicate, supply soldiers, give equipment to medical personel, and other assorted functions."

 # Anti-tank Support
  anti_tank_equipment_1: "Anti-tank Rifles"
  anti_tank_equipment_1_short: "Anti-tank Rifles"
  anti_tank_equipment_1_desc: "Old large caliber anti tank rifles can be leveraged to provide armour penetration to infantry units. Even if the capacity of these guns to penetrate armour is limited, they still serve their purpose."

  anti_tank_equipment_2: "Rocket Launchers"
  anti_tank_equipment_2_short: "Rocket Launchers"
  anti_tank_equipment_2_desc: "A rocket launcher is a device that launches an unguided, rocket-propelled projectile. Effective at destroying armoured units with its rocket-propelled design, and it's shaped charge warhead."

  anti_tank_equipment_3: "Missile Launchers"
  anti_tank_equipment_3_short: "Missile Launchers"
  anti_tank_equipment_3_desc: "A missile, also known as a guided missile, is a guided self-propelled system, as opposed to an unguided self-propelled munition, referred to as a rocket.). Guided Missile systems have a far higher chance to hit targets where it hurts."

 # fighters
  fighter_equipment_1: "Glider"
  fighter_equipment_1_short: "Glider"
  fighter_equipment_1_desc: "Our engineers have, after multiple stressful tests, invented a glider able to strike from the sky. Armed with two sub-machineguns, a compliment of grenades for ground strikes, and a lot of prayers, our pilots can now support frontline troops. A mobile catapult system, installed on a truck bed for launching procedures, also gives them a considerably increased range, as the trucks have more autonomy than our gliders."

  fighter_equipment_3: "Monoplane Fighter"
  fighter_equipment_3_short: "Monoplane Fighter"
  fighter_equipment_3_desc: "As speed and low drag become primordial, a monoplane design is now preferable. Increased weight capacity allows the installation of a third, air-cooled, higher caliber machinegun for gun runs, as well as external struts able to support two 50kg high explosive bombs. Stacked powerpack units allow higher top speed, giving us the possibility for increased strike range, and interception techniques against enemy crafts."

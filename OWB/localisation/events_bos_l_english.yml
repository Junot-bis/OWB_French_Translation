  nf_brotherhood.1.d: "On October 10, 2077, Captain Maxson and his men discovered, to their horror, that the West-Tek scientists at Mariposa were using military prisoners as unwilling test subjects for their genetically engineered Forced Evolutionary Virus (F.E.V.). How he dealt with these scientists would set a precedent for the Brotherhood."
  nf_brotherhood.1.a: "Their value in knowledge was greater than their sin."
  nf_brotherhood.1.b: "He slew them, for there is such a thing as too much science."

  nf_brotherhood.2.t: "Expedition into the Glow"
  nf_brotherhood.2.d: "In 2134, an emerging faction of the Brotherhood, led by Sergeant Dennis Allen, petitioned the Council of Elders for permission to explore the remnants of the West-Tek research facility in search of technological artefacts. The approval or denial of his passage would resonate forever within the Brotherhood."
  nf_brotherhood.2.a: "He was approved, discovery was worth the risk."
  nf_brotherhood.2.b: "He was denied, certain planning was needed."

  nf_brotherhood.3.t: "The Vipers"
  nf_brotherhood.3.d: "In 2155, the Brotherhood sent a handful of squads out into the Wasteland to track the Vipers down. To the Elders, this seemed a glorified training exercise, as they were convinced that a small detachment of Brotherhood troops in power armour would be sufficient to deal with a band of raiders, no matter how large. One Brotherhood squad, led by High Elder Maxson II himself, located the Vipers. Expecting the raiders to break and run at the sight of such a heavily armed force, Maxson did not take into account the Vipers' zeal and ferocity... or their poisoned weapons. A single arrow nicked the High Elder while he had his helmet off, leading to his death a few hours later."
  nf_brotherhood.3.a: "The Brotherhood Retreated!"
  nf_brotherhood.3.b: "The Brotherhood Avenged Maxson!"

  nf_brotherhood.4.t: "The Battle of Navarro."
  nf_brotherhood.4.d: "The War with the Enclave was the greatest opportunity the Brotherhood had found in decades. Hundreds of pieces of advanced tech and ancient secrets ripe for the taking. To this end, the brotherhood brought its full might to the battle, mustering over a thousand paladins from various bunkers and subgroups across the wasteland. However, during the battle it become apparent that the seething mass that was the NCR's grand army was vastly outmatched, and suffering heavy casualties. The moral dilemma of the Brotherhood was paramount. Did they gather technology, did they follow the prime directive? Or did they protect the men and women of the NCR? Those whom only the Brotherhood of Steel could protect?"
  nf_brotherhood.4.a: "Let the NCR distract them, Navarro's secrets will be ours!"

  nf_brotherhood.6.t: "An Alliance with Arroyo?"
  nf_brotherhood.6.d: "The Men and Women of Arroyo have been in our good graces for a long while, for it was they who produced the Chosen One who saved the wasteland so long ago. We could offer them protection and an alliance, for we already hear troubling reports of super mutant activity in the far north."
  nf_brotherhood.6.a: "They would make fine allies!"
  nf_brotherhood.6.b: "This is a waste of resources."

  nf_brotherhood.7.t: "Trouble on the Homefront"
  nf_brotherhood.7.d: "Recently a group of Brotherhood Paladins attacked and killed a Shi patrol, believing them to be raiders. The Shi have demanded a response from us. We should answer carefully, lest we damage our diplomatic standing with this technologically advanced faction."

  nf_brotherhood.7.c: "The Shi were punished for interfering!"

  nf_brotherhood.8.t: "Silicone Valley Expedition"
  nf_brotherhood.8.d: "Silicone Valley holds secrets that even we have not yet found, and every few years, the Western Brotherhood makes a point of launching an expedition into the area. What can be found with this most recent sweep?"
  nf_brotherhood.8.a: "An ancient computer."
  nf_brotherhood.8.b: "A stockpile of high quality metal."

  nf_brotherhood.9.t: "Curbing Raider Aggression"
  nf_brotherhood.9.d: "The people of what was once San-Francisco are constantly plague by raider groups, despite our best efforts. Recently, a local mobster has come forward, offering to use his manpower and resources to limit the actions of the raiders in exchange for a personal pardoning..."
  nf_brotherhood.9.a: "Who better to stop criminals than criminals?"
  nf_brotherhood.9.b: "The Brotherhood is above consorting with such people!"

  nf_brotherhood.13.b: "Giving anything to the Brotherhood is dangerous."

  nf_brotherhood.14.t: "The NCR accepts our Terms"
  nf_brotherhood.14.d: "The NCR has agreed to trade the industrial equipment for the military information and guides. We were finished with them decades ago, and these machines shall take us far!"
  nf_brotherhood.14.a: "A worthy arrangement."

  nf_brotherhood.15.t: "The NCR refuses our terms."
  nf_brotherhood.15.d: "The NCR is unwilling to part with machines they can't even use! Clearly, they seek to limit us at every turn. We shall have to made do with what we can find in Maxson, and our San Francisco territories."
  nf_brotherhood.15.a: "We'll make do."

  nf_brotherhood.16.t: "Vandenberg Expedition"
  nf_brotherhood.16.d: "When the bombs fell many places were ready to attempt to repel them, and Vandenberg was one such location. Its silos were filled with anti-air missiles, its radar was constantly watching the horizon, and its defences were state of the art. Now, however, it is simply a glowing wreckage of twisted rebar and massive steel chasms filled with goo and old tech."
  nf_brotherhood.16.a: "Prioritize reclaiming the rare components."
  nf_brotherhood.16.b: "Gather all the fuel and scrap we can."

  nf_brotherhood.17.t: "Lasers for Men?"
  nf_brotherhood.17.d: "The Brotherhood have sent a scout with a holotape from their quartermaster at Lost Hills. The brotherhood has a surplus of lasers that he doesn't feel the Brotherhood will need, but stresses that what they do need is capable men. He'll agree to have them sent our way if we will send some Rangers to assist the Brotherhood."

  nf_brotherhood.17.b: "They refuse."

  nf_brotherhood.18.t: "The Shipments arrive"
  nf_brotherhood.18.d: "The shipments sent by the brotherhood of Steel have finally arrived. Even now, we are deploying a number of volunteers to their front."
  nf_brotherhood.18.a: "Weapons at last!"

  nf_brotherhood.19.t: "Wait, why would they do that?"
  nf_brotherhood.19.d: "This wasn't a very good idea anyhow."

  nf_brotherhood.22.t: "Demand The Bay"
  nf_brotherhood.22.d: "With the recent conquest and occupation of San-Francisco we are one step closer to fully securing the Bay Area. Now that our hold of the area is undisputed we should make a demand of the NCR to hand over Point-Green to us. Although not particularly important strategically, the location has good infrastructure that would allow us to expand our operations in the bay - and it would also provide a crucial buffer leading up to the Golden Gate Bridge."
  nf_brotherhood.22.a: "Send the demand immediately."

  nf_brotherhood.23.t: "The Brotherhood's Ultimatum."
  nf_brotherhood.23.d: "After the worrying news of the Brotherhood annexing the Shi reached Shady Sands, it was almost immediately followed by a demand from the Brotherhood themselves. Looking to finally secure their grasp on the Bay Area once and for all, the Brotherhood are demanding that we hand over control of Point-Green to them. Point-Green, while not rural in any respect, is also not a significantly important part of the NCR as a whole. The Brotherhood have assured us that handing over the area would be a strong step in the right direction for future cooperation."
  nf_brotherhood.23.a: "Point-Green? They can have it."
  nf_brotherhood.23.b: "To hell with that!"

  nf_brotherhood.24.t: "The NCR Refuse!"
  nf_brotherhood.24.d: "Only a couple of days after sending our demand to the NCR, we were sent a message in return; the contents of which are not agreeable. The NCR has decried our demand and insists that Point-Green is theirs, and shall remain theirs. It appears that any hope of securing the bay without provoking war have been dashed."
  nf_brotherhood.24.a: "So be it."

  nf_brotherhood.34.t: "The Maxson Brigade"
  nf_brotherhood.34.d: "The choice to defend the men and women of the NCR was a costly one, dozens of Brotherhood Paladins giving their lives in heated close quarters combat, even as the Enclave destroyed hundreds of records and schematics in the depths of the Navarro Bunker. Many among the NCR never understood the depth of this sacrifice, the moral turning-point for the Brotherhood that was them finally placing human lives above technology. But those from the Maxson brigade, who had grown up within Brotherhood territory? They understood more than any other group, and following their disbandment after the war, went on to become a series of militias loosely associated with the Brotherhood of Steel."
  nf_brotherhood.34.a: "We are honoured to have them at our side."

  nf_brotherhood.35.t: "The Vagrants Support us!"
  nf_brotherhood.35.d: "The People of San Francisco have rallied around the story of Brotherhood Paladins protecting civilians from violent Shi thugs. A. Ron Meyers, a former Enclave Technician who helped the Chosen One to reach the infamous Oil Rig, has thrown in his lot with us as well. Bringing with him his supporters, who represent the poor and downtrodden of Shi-town."
  nf_brotherhood.35.a: "Welcome Mister Meyers."

  nf_brotherhood.36.t: "An Unfortunate Accident"
  nf_brotherhood.36.d: "While neither side is happy with this encounter, or how it went, both sides are willing to let it slide. We have studies the tactics used by the Shi in battle, and claimed many of the firearms from their dead, if only so we are prepared ever have to fight the Emperor."
  nf_brotherhood.36.a: "A healthy precaution."

  nf_brotherhood.37.t: "The Gates to Paradise Close"
  nf_brotherhood.37.d: "The Emperor is outraged with out blatant disrespect for his authority, and the lives of his soldiers. He has banned his people from both trade and interaction with us, and will no longer hear our delegations, or tolerate our presence anywhere near his territory."
  nf_brotherhood.37.a: "Who cares for the rambling of a machine?"

  nf_brotherhood.38.t: "The NCR gave us The Bay"
  nf_brotherhood.38.d: "After much waiting we finally received a reply from the NCR. They will turn over the territory of Point-Green effective immediately, and have already begun to move troops and military resources from the area. This marks a change in the diplomatic air between us and the NCR, and could potentially lead to mutually beneficial agreements in the future."
  nf_brotherhood.38.a: "Time to reopen the bunker up there."

  nf_brotherhood.39.t: "Rejected by [From.GetNameDef]"
  nf_brotherhood.39.d: "After an unexpectedly long delay, the emissaries of [From.GetNameDef] have returned with an answer from [From.GetLeader]. The answer is no. If we are to subjugate the [From.GetNameDef], we must do so by force."
  nf_brotherhood.39.a: "So be it."

  tbh_nf_rhombus_chase:0 "Mutants Chase"
  tbh_nf_rhombus_chase_desc:0 "Little Background Blurp about Rhombus heading to Texas to chase the remnants of the masters army. Gives a what kind of retinue he took with himself."
  tbh_nf_national_guard:0 "	Always Ready, Always There"
  tbh_nf_national_guard_desc:0 "TBH finds decendants of some national guard unit and their families, deciding if they integrate them proper into the military, or keep them as a civilian asset, use their knowhow for weapon production, or reject them."
  tbh_nf_texas_rangers:0 "One Ranger, One Riot"
  tbh_nf_texas_rangers_desc:0 "Some Texas ranger survivors join TBH, little lore blurb, no choice involved."

  tbh_nf_development_1:0 "Dallas Developments"
  tbh_nf_development_1_desc:0 "The ruins of Dallas have proven a very effective fundament for civilian life to flourish under Brotherhood governance, let us further this with subtle involvements. The best economy is a guided economy."
  tbh_nf_development_2:0 "Fort Hood Developments"
  tbh_nf_development_2_desc:0 "Below the city of Hood lies a fort, a old military base that to this day nobody managed to crack fully. But even the surface is litered with useful salvage, let us use this to our advantage."
  tbh_nf_doctrinal_thought:0 "Doctrinal Thoughts"
  tbh_nf_doctrinal_thought_desc:0 "Our high command must never stop adapting to the constantly shifting conditions of the wastes, if we are to maintain military readiness in the harshest of situations. Providing them further resources and reports would help them make capital advances in improving the established doctrines of our troops as well as special forces."
  tbh_nf_doctrinal_thought_2:0 "Evaluate the Codex"
  tbh_nf_doctrinal_thought_2_desc:0 "The Brotherhood strategical codex has, for the longest time, been followed to the letter. But if we are to adapt to our new situation, we must study it in-depths and interpret it more as recommendations than as a strict guideline. It can, however, still teach us a few additional tricks."
  tbh_nf_our_path_roots:0 "Texas for Rusk"
  tbh_nf_our_path_roots_desc:0 "Rusk is right, what the wasteland need isn't another common army oppressing it's citizen and focusing more on waging war than on ensuring peace. Our oath was and still is to this day to enact the law, and protect our citizen against the harsh conditions they must endure daily. We cannot abandon this crucial task, lest we forget our pledge."
  tbh_nf_our_path_roots_2:0 "Rusk for Texas"
  tbh_nf_our_path_roots_2_desc:0 "Our brotherhood must be able to react to trouble quickly, and efficiently, if we are to secure our lands. Separating our forces into independent policing cells that can rapidly gain knowledge of the local terrain and it's population let us react much faster to threats once reinforcement comes in, able to be directed quickly by local officers."
  tbh_nf_roots_new_recruits:0 "Brotherhood Expansion"
  tbh_nf_roots_new_recruits_desc:0 "If we are to protect our nation, we will need additional volunteers, and a lot of them.

  tbh_nf_roots_new_weapons:0 "Brotherhood Guns"
  tbh_nf_roots_new_weapons_desc:0 "Our complacency and over-reliance on existing technology could very well be our downfall in our fight to bring order to the wastes.

  tbh_nf_our_path_new_shores:0 "A new way of thinking"
  tbh_nf_our_path_new_shores_desc:0 "Rusk is, of course, a respected and honorable elder that has guided our Brotherhood time and time again through history.

We will move away from the existing doctrines, and invent a new way to truly render the wasteland safe."
  tbh_nf_our_path_new_shores_2:0 "A new way of thinking part 2"
  tbh_nf_our_path_new_shores_2_desc:0 "Our reforms have proven effective already, but we cannot stop here, we must do all we can to never fall behind our enemies in term of technology. We will fund and equip various research cells across the country, dedicated to giving us the most advanced weaponry and equipment. Our technological edge will be key to our future efforts."
  tbh_nf_shores_new_tactics:0 "New Tactics"
  tbh_nf_shores_new_tactics_desc:0 "With our divisions moving away from Rusk's ideas of peacekeepers, we must revise our tactics as well as strategy to adapt to open warfare. A new group of military officers fresh out of the academy, full of ideas, and eager to prove their capabilities, should be able to do just that."
  tbh_nf_shores_new_vehicles:0 "New Vehicles"
  tbh_nf_shores_new_vehicles_desc:0 "If we are to wage war accross open terrain, we must be able to move swiftly and efficiently through the wastes, and for that we need vehicles.

  tbh_nf_listening_posts:0 "Establish Listening Posts"
  tbh_nf_listening_posts_desc:0 "In matters of war, reconnaissance is one of it's most essential aspect. Lack of intel can make or break any operations, as such it is capital to our efforts that we gain said intel rapidly. The establishment of radar-equipped listening posts, manned by trained specialists, will let us do just that."
  tbh_nf_national_excersizes:0 "Brotherhood excersizes"
  tbh_nf_national_excersizes_desc:0 "Close study of the exercises undertaken by every new recruit in our forces can give you good insight into their thinking, of particular interest is the fact some of the more clever members can sometime outright bypass obstacles in courses or difficulties in training, which we should specially pay attention to."
  tbh_nf_national_excersizes_2:0 "Brotherhood Training"
  tbh_nf_national_excersizes_2_desc:0 "The Brotherhood codex contains immense amount of military records from various campaigns dating back to it's creation, which is included both as a mean of remembrance and as lessons for future officers. Requiring our high command to study it and apply it's teaching would be beneficial."
  tbh_nf_national_excersizes_3:0 "Brotherhood Regimen"
  tbh_nf_national_excersizes_3_desc:0 "Immense inter-division mock battles, executed on neutral fields between rookie officers, is a good way to give battle experience to both our command corp as well as soldiers on the ground, and quickly find any flaw in our equipment or tactical teachings."
  tbh_nf_national_excersizes_4:0 "Brotherhood Drills"
  tbh_nf_national_excersizes_4_desc:0 "Vastly reformed army drills, combined with a veteran oversight system, can let us impart the wisdom of our more experienced soldiers onto our recruits, letting them benefit from vast tactical knowledge before even hitting the field."

 MXC_backbone_desc:9 "Colorado wasn't known for its infrastructure before the war. After the bombs dropped and 200 years of degradation, the roads are yet another victim with the fall of America. There won't be golden roads leading to Maxson Bunker, but at the very least we can stop some of the foot pain while on patrol."

 MXC_track_desc:9 "\"Plasma technology has been all but lost for manufactoring purposes, what is stopping that from eventually happening with laser weaponry? I trust our reclamation teams will do their best to stop our heritage from being lost to time. In the mean time, i'm going to make sure there won't be a lack of beam weapons. Now hand me that screwdriver.\" "
 MXC_envoy:9 "Maddox Conley"
 MXC_envoy_desc:9 "When the Maxson Chapter fought the Hangdogs, they learned that the wastes would always have the advantage. Even with the strongest armour and biggest gun, it won't do anything if no one is around to use it. Allowing promising wastelanders to join our ranks or atleast work along side us will keep Roger Maxson's dream alive."

 MXC_integration_desc:9 "\"You have to think about it from a Wastelander's perspective. Everything out there simply wants to use them or abuse them. They don't know they can be something greater than just a farmhand or a raider. With a bit of knowledge and meeting them halfway, they could start to help more than just themselves.\" "

 MXC_victorium:9 "Broderick Caldwell"
 MXC_victorium_desc:9 "The Brotherhood has not survived due to idealogical strength alone. Troopers clad in power armour take the field, no longer incapicated from a rogue shot. With armour to protect the valuable soldier inside, the full potential of a knight can be unleashed."

 MXC_wasteland:9 "Knight Hardee"
 MXC_wasteland_desc:9 "Humanity killed itself to sustain its war machine. Trying to keep an army of power armour suits in the field is a goal that will get the Brotherhood killed. By working on non-powered infantry and improving the average soldier, we can ensure the survival of the Brotherhood."

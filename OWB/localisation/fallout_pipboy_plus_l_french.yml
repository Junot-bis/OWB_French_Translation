 PIPBOY_PLUS_NATION_TEXT_ANT:0 "Nestled within the National Antelope Refuge north of New Reno, The [ANT.GetName] live out their lives in peace. Surrounded by mercantile and aggressive entities alike, they prefer to keep to themselves and live simple lives. They roam throughout the Black Rock Desert and beyond in search of salvage and prey. Their scrap of land is largely undesirable and desolate, like much of the wasteland, keeping conflict to a minimum.  The little conflict they've faced has been with the neighbouring Cyclops Tribe. Despite their isolationist and peaceful nature, their heated relations with the Cyclops have continued for generations. Few pleasantries are exchanged between their hunting parties. Relations are warmer along their southern border with New Reno. Antelope hunters often make the trip to New Reno to sell furs and crafts if they've strayed far south of the Black Rock Desert. Although trade with Chemult station is preferred, the capital of sin offers many luxuries and services the former cannot provide.  Recreational drugs are often bought en-mass from New Reno, alongside ammunition and tools.\n\nAlthough the tribe's name originated from their location alone, centuries later antelopes have become a central part of their cultural identity. Mature antelopes are ritualistically butchered, and their components used for many crafts. Antelope horns are often used to create elaborate headdresses worn by hunters; with hunters expanding upon their design as they become more seasoned. Antelope hide is an essential part of clothing and identity within the tribe, seen as more valuable than the hide of other animals. To own an antelope coat, let alone a bedroll, is a high honour. The meat of their livestock is perhaps most valued of all, used in large community stews for great events. Antelopes are sacred to the tribe, and are killed sparingly. Hunters and foragers have special importance to the Antelope Tribe because of this.  Livestock rearers, those who raise and protect the antelopes, often hold religious authority.  Outsiders who are permitted to enter the lands of the tribe often share stories of their rich culture far beyond their borders. On rare occasions, outsiders are presented with talismans of carved antelope horn. These talismans are important protective charms to the tribe, and are imparted with great religious and emotional significance. It is said the Desert Buck eternally safeguards those who carry its icon."
  PIPBOY_PLUS_NATION_TEXT_ARM: "Occupying the northern portion of Mexico's east coast, the [ARM.GetName] lives up to its name. Comprised of unwilling conscripts enslaved by the robotic serfs of the army's leader, it strives for the reconquest of Texas. Every day, the \"citizens\" living under the Army's control work, willingly or not, in its factories and dockyards. Its robotic taskmasters leave no room for error, ensuring the entire working population is productive. Workers are rewarded with a paltry amount of ration tokens, the bare minimum for a wage. Construction, salvaging, resource extraction, and farming are roles staffed by humans and overseen by robots. Escape from this draconian society is nigh impossible due to the nature of its ruler. The watchful eye of the ever-present A.I. Santa Anna will mercilessly hunt down those who dare to go against its grand vision. Escapees are regularly dragged back to their housing blocks, or for repeat offenders, publicly executed.\n\nThese extreme methods are employed not to be cruel, but due to a fundamental error with the overlord itself. Human lives are considered a valuable resource by Santa Anna, but a resource nonetheless. Resources are collected to be spent after-all. No one citizen of working age should go unused either, for wasting resources is wasting time, and time is something Santa Anna doesn't have. Its central authority, Tlaloc, is rapidly dying. Refusing to accept the inevitable fate ahead of itself, the A.I. will continue to charge ahead into the future; preparing for a war that may never come. The Army of Mexico is an army with a nation, not the other way around."
  PIPBOY_PLUS_NATION_TEXT_ARR: "Founded in 2167 by the Vault Dweller and their followers, the city of [ARR.GetName] has a turbulent history. Its location on the very edge of the N.C.R.'s sphere of influence has lead to many problems. In spite of this, its sheltered position in the great canyons has shielded it from most harm. Although originally consisting of relatively few people, Arroyo's population has blossomed into one of the most diverse found on the West Coast. Generations of warm external relations have contributed to the village's growth and prosperity. Arroyo has emerged as one of the Wasteland's most advanced and forward-thinking cities. Its sphere of influence extends beyond its own city limits, extending out into the vast wasteland beyond. Because of this, Arroyo holds notable sway over major players, such as the N.C.R., New Reno, and Vault City.\n\nArroyo has suffered many hardships despite its success in the modern age. In 2242, the Enclave attacked the city of Arroyo, capturing its residents to bring back to the Poseidon Oil Rig. Those who refused to surrender lost their lives, and only one man survived, the Chosen One. Returning to find his village in ruins, the Chosen One would eventually find and free his people; as well as put an end to the Enclave's sinister plan. Arroyo's long lost relatives, the residents of Vault 13, were also on the Poseidon Oil Rig. After their rescue, they decided to stay and rebuild Arroyo rather than travel hundreds of miles back home. Their technical expertise, combined with the tribe's survival skills, ushered in a new era of prosperity for Arroyo. As for the Chosen One, his actions forever immortalised him, and he went on to become the next Elder of Arroyo. He continues to lead his people to this very day, and will no doubt chart a path through the troubling times ahead."

  PIPBOY_PLUS_NATION_TEXT_BLO: "The §YBeltran-Levya§! Cartel was one one of the greatest empires of illicit trade in the old world, but now exists as little more than a shell of its former glory, clinging to what territory they have left in §YCore Region§!. Operating out of the once prosperous city of port city of §YMazatlan§!, while supporting territory that reaches up the coast and into the mountains as far north as §YNuevo Ideal§!. Their territory is a largely lawless region that has been built to be a fortress over the last few decades, focused heavily around key mountain passes and routes that they use to smuggle goods between the §YRepublic of the Rio Grande§! To their northeast and the §YViceroyality§! to their direct south. Along their longest, northern border, the enforcers of §YBeltran-Levya§! fight an unending battle with the zealous tribes of the §YFree Fighter Federation§!, which now holds the vast majority of their former territory. \n\nThe §YBeltran-Levya§! Cartel once had a fairly in depth organizational structure that allowed them to control much of the §YSinaloa§! region's trade, but failed to hold onto it in the face of the onslaught that was the rise of the masked luchador cults. Falling back into their own territory at an ever increasing rate, the cartel nearly crumbled inward during the last hundred years, and has only been propped up by a handful of brutal leaders and vicious policies. As a result, until recently cartel was a largely decentralized institution with innumerable gangs and sects vying for control of their scattered territory, often at the cost of profit and land. All of this changed with the rise of the §YBandido Sangriento§!, or as he'd be called in English, the Bloody Bandit of §YBeltran-Levya§! \n\nThe §YBandido Sangriento§! started as a simple enforcer for one of the leaders of the then crumbling §YBeltran-Levya§! Cartel, and quickly gained a terrible reputation for his overwhelmingly brutality towards the communities of his enemies. After a strike gone too far, in which the §YBandido Sangriento§! wiped out a small farming community for what was widely considered to be a minor slight, he was sentenced to death by the cartel. After being shot several times and thrown into a pit in the middle of, the §YBandido Sangriento§! returned as a mutated ghoul, claiming that his hatred was too great to let him die. Within a decade, he had wiped out the old guard of the §YBeltran-Levya§! cartel, and centralized them into a personal army, with which he intends to reclaim all of his lost lands."

  PIPBOY_PLUS_NATION_TEXT_ITZ: "The §!Chichen Itzan Empire§! originates from a small tribe on the Yucatan peninsula. These founders worshipped the old gods, those of the Mayan civilizations millennia before them, and based their activities around the Chichen Itza, a huge step pyramid that survives to this day. Over the next century, the Itza gradually spread their influence, consuming the entire Yucatan peninsula and spreading northwards along the coastline. It was during the initial ascendancy of the empire that the Itza's focus on the sea began. The Itzan navy, beginning from a few small fishing boats, rapidly grew to become the terror of the Gulf of Mexico. During these years the fleet mainly operated a piracy policy, choosing to raid settlements on islands or on the coast for their wealth, which then passed back to the capital. \n\nAs a result, the Chichen Itza and the town that sprang up around it flourished in the first century of the Itza's existence. Other major coastal towns also did very well for themselves, enjoying strong naval trade links with each other. These cities in turn paid the agricultural workers inland for their labour, creating an efficient network of commerce that relied on raids and conquest to keep itself sustained. \n\nHowever, in the year 2102, a new foe was sighted by the Itzan army. They wore cloaks like eagles, and seemed to observe similar rituals to the Itza themselves. The first exchanges with this new civilization were friendly, but in 2139, things got hairy. Both the Itza and the Aztlan, unbeknownst to the other, had launched an invasion of [TDT.GetName], a large inland tribe following similar customs to both groups. Both sides were met with initial success against the [TDT.GetNameDef] forces, but a fatal clash occurred in October that would set the tone of the relationship between the Aztlan and the Itza forevermore. Both sides mistook the other for [TDT.GetName], and in the bedlam that ensued some 40,000 troops were killed or seriously wounded on each side. The first formal war soon followed, a three-way struggle for control of [TDT.GetName], and lasted for three years as each side vied for control of ridges and rivers. The war ultimately ending inconclusively, to the great embarrassment of both the Itza and the Aztlan. \n\nThe war proved to be the first of many, and from 2139 to 2228, the Itza and the Aztlan were locked in a perpetual border conflict. Hundreds of thousands of lives were extinguished in the jungles and hills of the borderlands, and thousands more were extinguished on the temples across the Itza to appease the war gods. Whilst the fighting was inconclusive, one thing was becoming apparent—the Aztlan were gaining the upper hand. At every major battle from around 2190 onwards, the Aztlan were able to field more men and, crucially, their feared Jaguar warriors. Slowly but surely, the Itza were being beaten back by the Aztlan war machine. \n\nThe Aztlan's war machine reached its zenith in 2228. Under brilliant generals, the Aztlan were conquering territory on an unprecedented scale, and once the Aztlan's northern foes had begun to crumble they turned their hungry eyes on the Itza. For two years, fierce fighting scarred the jungles. A war the Itza initially thought was just another clash swiftly became a war for survival. The bleak situation was none the more apparent than at the Battle of the Balsas River, where an entire Itzan army was outnumbered, outmanoeuvred and subsequently thoroughly routed. More than half the force was killed or captured in the battle alone. The remaining Itzan forces began a headlong retreat to the Yucatan peninsula, hounded continuously by the Aztlan forces seeking to destroy them once and for all. \n\nOn the 12th of March 2232, the routed Itzan forces reached the Papaloapan River. By the orders of the current monarch, Gustavo Fontirroig, the bridges across the river had been destroyed. Whilst this temporarily protected the Yucatan peninsula from the advancing Aztlan forces, it also trapped the remnants of the Itzan forces on the wrong side of the river. Desperate and all but broken, they tuned and faced down their foe one last time. The Battle of the Papaloapan River ensured. \n\nItzan forces, tired and underequipped, initially crumbled against the Aztlan's Jaguar vanguard, but then destiny rolled the dice once more. A young general named Sebastián, no more than 19, climbed to the top of the hill on which the Itza seemed doom to die on. Upon reaching the top, he found chaos. Most of the Itzan commands structure had either retreated or been killed by a stray artillery shot. Sebastián knew that order had to be wrung from the chaos, or the Itza were doomed to die. At first nobody listened to his ideas, but soon a single unit of the Ejército, the elites of the Itza, followed his orders. Under his leadership, the unit succeeded in breaking a weakly defended portion of the Aztlan line, breaking out of the encirclement. Whilst the Itzan force was too disorganised to capitalise on the breakthrough, Sebastián's forces succeeded in snatching much-needed medical supplies and ammunition before falling back. Seeing his bravery and tactical brilliance, more and more units of the Itzan forces pledged to follow his lead, until the entire army, or what remained of it, was under his command by the early evening. \n\nTired and bloody, Sebastián ordered his men into defensive positions for what he thought would be the last stand of the great Itza Army. The Aztlan, spearheaded by a seemingly endless quantity of Jaguars, began their charge. Fighting ensured into the early morning, as the Itzan forces continuously retreated up the hill, reforming their defensive circle in an organised fashion. The circle, according to Sebastián's orders, was composed entirely of Itzan militia-infantry. Behind this front line, Sebastián placed units of the Ejército at regular intervals, ready to plug any gaps that may appear in the line, or exploit any gaps in the enemies. Whilst the plan was simple, it proved to be deadly effective. Not once was there a serious break in the Itzan line, and when the number of Itzan militia-infantry defenders began to become too thin to hold the line, Sebastián ordered a retreat up the hill, reducing the line's circumference. \n\nAs dawn crept over the battlefield an unexpected sight greeted Sebastián. Dead Jaguars scattered the ground, packed densely in front of the defensive positions he himself had devised. Ejército units still manned their posts, though most had passed out from tiredness, as the last Aztlan crumbled. Sebastián was adored by the soldiers who's lives he had saved. Over the following days the rest of the Itzan army, scattered across the Papaloapan River, rallied under him. It was clear Sebastián's army was now both the largest and finest fighting force in the jungle. \n\nThe dominance of Sebastián's force was shown once and for all two months later. The Itzan force advanced to the Balsas river once more, this time perusing rather than being pursued by the Aztlan forces. On the banks of the Balsas, Sebastián delivered a decisive defeat to the Aztlan once more, a crippling blow that ensured the Aztlan forces would never again threaten the Itzan homeland. \n\nSebastián's next move, however, was not to march into the Aztlan heartlands, as he was urged to do by the Itzan monarch. Instead Sebastián turned his army around, marching swiftly to the Papaloapan River before utilising his army to repair bridges and trade links. Three months later, he struck out again, this time marching into the Yucatan peninsula. There he and his army were met with widespread support, and men flocked to his banner. However, Sebastián refused to stop and regiment these willing recruits, telling them to return to their fields and ensure the country resisted any famine, whilst he marched on the Chichen Itza itself. When he got there, he purged the political elite that resided there as a form of revenge for cutting the bridges over the Papaloapan River. In a personal act of revenge, he killed the Kalomte Gustavo personally and publicly, before declaring himself the new Kalomte of the Itza. The King of Kings. \n\nOver the next 43 years, from his coronation in 2232 to 2275, the Kalomte Sebastián led the Itza from victory to victory. Of note was his decisive defeat of [TDT.GetName], driving them back over the Usumacinta River, as well the strengthening of trade and diplomatic links between the Itza and [GRH.GetName]. Now, at the dawn of 2275, the Kalomte is drawing up plans cement Itzan dominance across the entire Mexican coastline. "

Isolated on their oil rig for centuries, the organisation became xenophobic and convinced of their own genetic superiority to the mainland population, culminating in an attempt to genocide the entire planet by President 'Dick' Richardson. This attempt was foiled by the Chosen One of Arroyo, which had been sacked by the Enclave in pursuit of test subjects for the biochemical weapons to be used in this scheme. The oil rig was sabotaged by the Chosen One and destroyed in a nuclear explosion, killing Richardson and many of the Enclave's leadership. Following this, some years later the Enclave base of Navarro was captured by an alliance of the NCR and Brotherhood of Steel, leaving nothing but shattered groups of remnants, hunted and persecuted throughout the wastes, incapable of rising up again. Now the Enclave is a tattered remnant on the West Coast. One would need to be as firm as Granite to bring them back... \n"

  PIPBOY_PLUS_NATION_TEXT_NCR: "§YThe New California Republic§!—better known as the §YN.C.R.§!—is a nation of humble beginnings; originating from the small walled town of §YShady Sands§!. In 2186 they declared themselves a republic and took on their eponymous name: electing a democratic council to write up a constitution and lead the nation. After 3 years the §YN.C.R.§! had grown from a small city to a federation of cities comprised of several prominent trading hubs. The §YN.C.R.'s§! (at the time) disparate towns were held together by a common need for protection and the threat of dehydration.\n\nThe §YN.C.R.§! has in many ways modelled themselves off-of the former §YUnited States§! with legislative, executive, and judicial branches. While the democratic process of the §YN.C.R.§! has many advantages, the nation is plagued by corruption. Often the states of the §YRepublic§! clash with each other in an attempt to further their own self interests; delegitimising the federal government. Many within the §YRepublic§! have pointed out its flaws; however despite the people's frustrations with the system it refuses to change. The §YN.C.R.'s§! economic sector is \"in bed\" with the government and regularly lobbies to maintain its privileges.\n\nFurther similarties can be derived between the §YN.C.R.§! and its historic inspiration in another of its institutions: the army. The §YN.C.R.§! has large but under-funded armed forces branch which places little emphasis placed on training: troops are considered fully trained after a mere two to three weeks. In stark contrast to their ineffectual main forces, the §YN.C.R.§! also employs highly trained and experienced special forces—the §YRangers§!. The differences between these two factions are night and day, but both make up an important part of the §YN.C.R.'s§! military might.\n\nThe power of the §YRepublic§! is unquestionable: its direction, however, is up for debate. Various solutions have been given to solve the problems that plague the §YRepublic§!; but it's not clear which choices are correct. The §YN.C.R.§! walks a fine line in the §YWasteland§!: it is at once a beacon of liberty and an all-encompassing hegemonic entity. Like all things in the §YWasteland§!, the §YN.C.R.§! is not as simple as it appears."
  PIPBOY_PLUS_NATION_TEXT_NEW: "§YNew Reno§! calls itself the Biggest Little City In The Wasteland; most people know it as a wretched hive of scum and villainy, an oozing sore of gambling and drug dealing and prostitution ... and also a major entrepot for most of Nevada, and an important stopping point on the Big Circle caravan route. After the Great War, New Reno was taken over by various gangsters, and today many crime families, big and small, call the city home and collectively act as its de facto government. But the biggest are the Bishops, the Wrights, the Mordinos, and last of all the Salvatores, whose fortunes sank for decades after the destruction of the Enclave and have only recently recovered. The Bishops, led by an illegitimate scion who rose to prominence through his knowledge of the wasteland, seeks to gain dominance through partnership with the Van Graff crime family - and perhaps ally New Reno with the NCR. The Wrights seek to make New Reno an honest, temperate city, and will take any measure to fulfill this desire ... including an alliance with some remnants of the Master's Army. The Mordinos seek to create an even more addictive form of Jet and use it to build an empire of adddiction. And last of all, the Salvatores seek only to gain power ... and some whisper they are only the puppets of their old allies... \n"

After decades of state-crafting at the hands of the §YN.C.R.§!, the §YWest Coast§! was transformed from a barren and lawless land, to a somewhat populated, slightly less lawless one. Without a place in the new society that had sprung up around them, many tribes travelled east to find refuge along the §YColorado River§!. The Rapids are the result of this great exodus: a large coalition of tribes settled along the south east of the §YColorado§!.\n\nTheir primary sources of income are fish trading, mercenary work, and transportation services. A large portion of their trade comes in the form of regular pit-stops by caravaners who seek to travel the lands of §YCaesar's Legion§!. These traders bring wealth, goods, news, and arms to the tribes of the §YColorado§!. Often, §YThe Rapids§!

Unlike other raider gangs, however, they have managed to turn their small-time petty chem peddling gig into a fully fledged occupation of the south east of the §YCore Region§!. How exactly they managed to go from a gang of wannabee dealers to a large outfit of gun-toting gangers strong enough to threaten the region is unclear: but the cracks are already beginning to show.\n\nWhat is readily apparent however is that the §YScorpions§! have capitalised on one of the precious few trade routes into §YNew Vegas§!, harvesting the cap rich caravans heading east along the §YI-15§! for all that they're worth to prop up their failing operation. While control of the highway gives them a constant supply of fresh targets, it also puts them in constant conflict with well-armed caravan guards, and adds more unnecessary strain on their already stretched military.\n\nTheir large swathes of territory are in-of-themselves a problem due to the §YScorpion's§! inherent inability to effectively subjugate and control the population under their boot. The small towns within their occupied turf frequently arm militias and clash with the under-trained and disorganised raiders, causing tension within the already unwieldy ranks of the gang. In response to this they've spread even thinner: and the result has so far been a drop in combat performance, rampant factionalism and infighting, and mass desertion.\n\nAlthough this situation is fixable on its own, the looming threat of imminent §YN.C.R.§! involvement has effectively doomed the future prospects of the gang. Unless the §YScorpions§! can gain control of their own territory for long enough to fend off the impending §YN.C.R.§! clean-up operation, there is no doubt that they will not live to see 2281 as any more than a petty gang squatting in the §YMojave§!."

In 2275, the §YT.A.A.§! arm themselves not out of a sense of moral obligation, but as a way to survive and exert power over others.

The largest, wealthiest, and most influential of the families within the §YT.A.A.§! are those who hold numerous patents and have the workers to produce them: while the smallest are either mere vendors or specialist manufacturers being kept down by their competition.

Meanwhile, profits are declining as the cost of hiring soldiers rises dramatically. Each family wants a slice of the pie, and none of them want to share.

Cette catégorie est toutefois la plus risquée des quatre - les technologies du Vieux Monde, qui n'ont pas encore été découvertes, sont probablement bien gardées! \n\n§R- Types de recherche -§!\n§YParties de récupération standard§!: le type de recherche le plus fondamental et le moins cher. Envoyez simplement 50 hommes armés avec des armes à feu dans les Terres Désolées, et espérez qu'ils reviennent vivants! Ce type prend le plus de temps et fait partie des plus risqués, mais si vous n'avez pas d'alternative, cela vaut la peine de l'investissement.\n§YArmure Assistée§!: Equiper votre équipe de recherche en armure assistée est un moyen sûr de les protéger, mais n'améliorera pas beaucoup la vitesse d'une mission. Ce type est une bonne idée si vous êtes serré en hommes mais pas avec les bras, et se débloquera si vous recherchez la technologie des armures de puissance.\n§YVéhicules§!: Les charognards à vélo ou même en voiture seront beaucoup plus rapides que ceux qui n'en ont pas ! Ce type n'améliorera pas beaucoup la survie mais, ce que vos récupérateurs gagneront en vitesse, ils perdront en cible de choix pour les gangs de pillards locaux. Si vous avez besoin d'équipement rapide, c’est le type qui vous convient.\n§YAvion§!: plus rapide et plus sûr, envoyer vos charognards dans un avion de transport leur permettra de trouver les objets rapidement et de s’éloigner du danger encore plus rapidement. Si vous avez l'équipement nécessaire pour le faciliter, la récupération à bord d'un avion est la voie à suivre.\n\n§RATTENTION : §!\nLa récupération et ses décisions doivent faire l’objet d’une refonte totale dans la version 2.1, car leur créateur (HappyNTH) n’est pas entièrement satisfait de la façon dont cela fonctionne. Les suggestions d'amélioration sont toujours les bienvenues sur Discord !"

 PIPBOY_PLUS_CREDITS_TEXT_CREDITS:0 "Old World Blues n'auraient pas été possible sans l'équipe magnifique de développeurs qui travaille actuellement dessus. Chacun d'eux a apporté des compétences uniques et des process au mod, sans quoi il n'aurait pas été possible d'atteindre ce niveau de qualité. L'équipe OWB : \n\n§YAlex, CelsiuZ, chacolah, Dan, David M, evil_c0okie, Faeelin, Foulsbane, Garnithor, HappyNTH, ICodeMaster, Indyclone77, LightningEagle, LimonenZitrone, Loonybinjin, Mechano, MrBlazzar, PineapplePansy, Ritter Runkel, shawniepie, Shudderfly, Skip, Soviet_Cyber, T the Light Tank, The Colonel, Striam, wtchappell, theddd1, Zapdude, Zusk and Эльдар§! \n\nNous remercions grandement tous les développeurs qui étaient avec nous mais ont depuis quitté l'équipe\n\nNous voulons aussi remercier nos testeurs (ceux de l'Alpha, la 1.1 et la 2.0) pour leur dur labeur et dévouement à rendre le mod jouable et agréable pour vous, les fans. Sans leurs conseils et leurs directives, nous nous serions épuisés il y a longtemps, et le lancement aurait été encore plus désastreux qu'il ne l'a été.\n\nLa communauté de modding HOI4 a également été incroyablement utile dans la création, et la continuation, de Old World Blues. Sans l'attitude amicale et serviable de nombreux membres de la communauté, nous aurions eu du mal à surmonter certains problèmes, et cet esprit de coopération que nous nous efforçons de toujours suivre.\n\nLes artistes suivants ont des œuvres qui ont été utilisées dans le mod. Si vous souhaitez trouver des liens vers ces artistes et leurs pages, consultez la page Steam Workshop ou demandez dans notre Discord. Pour des questions spécifiques ou autres, n'hésitez pas à les poser dans notre Discord.\n\n§RStraidy§! :  Portraits de dirigeants et images d'événements\n§RTakeOFFFly§! : Images d'événements \n§RfenandOfc§!: Portraits de dirigeants\n§RSkizoh§! : Portraits de dirigeants\n§RJosh Jertberg and Andrée Wallin§! : Portraits de dirigeants\n§RIyad Sabouni§!: Menu pour la 1.0 \n§RSgtDelta§! : Images d'événements\n§R5ofnovember§! : Images d'événements\n§RMarko-Djurdjevic§! : Portraits de dirigeants \n§RBeardedwonder95§! : Captures décran de Fallout pour des images d'événement\n§RMario Rico§! : Portraits de dirigeant\n§RKristianKnutsen§! : 3D \n§RNewbStyle§!: 3D\n\nEnfin, les personnes les plus importantes dans la création de ce mod : \n\nVous les gars. Les joueurs. Les fans. Ceux d'entre vous qui signalent des bugs, ou qui cassent le jeu, ou qui discutent de notre mod en profondeur. Ceux d'entre vous qui font des suggestions, ou qui contribuent au code, ou qui nous posent des questions difficiles. Ceux d'entre vous qui jouent notre mod. En fin de compte, l'équipe du mod est une bande d'amis, et ce qui nous motive n'est pas seulement les uns les autres, mais aussi la joie de voir les gens jouer, apprécier et aimer notre humble mod.\n\n§YAlors, merci à tous et à toutes.§!"

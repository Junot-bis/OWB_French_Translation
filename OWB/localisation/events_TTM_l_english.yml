  nf_ttm.6.t: "Beauty of Paradise"
  nf_ttm.6.d: "Paradise is the name the tribals living here call this state, a marvellous ecological paradise within the waste, hidden between the mountain. While this place is marvellous -.. we have a feeling that something is hidden behind the fauna of this place. Large metal gates and hidden pathways give the impression that there is something working here outside of our grasp."
  nf_ttm.6.a: "Still, its pretty."

  nf_ttm.7.t: "The Nursery Operational"
  nf_ttm.7.d: "The Nursery is where Diana currently lives, a hidden bunker far away from the lands of the Twin Mothers. We use a complex series of scouts and tunnels to send resources towards the Twin Mothers from this location - the best part? The rest of the wasteland is none the wiser as to our inhabitation here."
  nf_ttm.7.a: "§M"My Garden of Eden..."§!"

  nf_ttm.8.t: "Managing the Nursery"
  nf_ttm.8.d: "The Nursery is a miracle of pre-War engineering. It is a self-contained balanced ecological system set within a deep canyon. The valley floor of the canyon is rife with the flora and fauna of times past. At the head of the valley is a lake of crystal blue water that feeds a river. The river flows from one end of the valley to the other, disappearing into the canyon wall. Bordering the lake are several buildings that house the maintenance equipment that keeps the Nursery functioning. The Nursery is where Diana lives, from there she can project herself to Vault 29 within Twin Mothers territory and lead the tribe.\n\nThe Nursery is not located within our owned territory at the start of the game. It is located deep within Black Canyon territory, within the state "Paradise". The location of the Nursery is so secret that the Black Canyon raiders do not even know of our existence there.\n\nManaging the Nursery is practically a full time job for Diana, hover over your "Nursery" idea to get a complete tooltip explaining the various factors involved within managing the Nursery."
  nf_ttm.8.a: "§M"Must I bother? This is so boring..."§!"

  nf_ttm.9.t: "Ecological Imbalance"
  nf_ttm.9.d: "The Nursery's gardens has been suffering an amount of.. ecological imbalance ever since Miles Reese charmed his way into the Nursery, only to steal a G.E.C.K. from us and wreck havoc across the wasteland. As of late botanical creatures and other monstrosities from Reese's G.E.C.K. threaten to upend the Gardens from the pre-war wildlife living here! We have a choice to make on if we want to try to tame the plants living here, or give the native creatures a helping hand so that they might bring back the intended order of this place."
  nf_ttm.9.a: "§M"Its important that these animals have a place to live."§!"
  nf_ttm.9.b: "§M"These new world plants might help our tribe survive though?"§!"

  nf_ttm.11.t: "Akeisha's Last Straw"
  nf_ttm.11.d: "Akeisha Moon and her group of Followers of the Apocalypse have been among the Twin Mothers for nearly twenty years - yet, our tribes recent militarization has caused them to grow weary of us. In protest Akeisha has taken her Followers of the Apocalypse and left our lands, heading back out west."
  nf_ttm.11.a: "§M"But I thought we were friends..."§!"
  nf_ttm.11.a.tt: "§YAkeisha Moon§! will retire as a Unit Leader, heading off west for greener pastures.\n"

  nf_ttm.20.t.l: "Knowledge of a New Tribe?"
  nf_ttm.20.t.t: "Raiders on the Horizon"
  nf_ttm.20.d.l: "After our conquest of the Archdiocese our scouts have been contacted by a member of Scorpion's Bite. They claim to have knowledge of a tribe hidden in the valleys to the north, filled with pre-war technology, protected by robots and led by a physical goddess in the Wasteland. A goddess known as "Diana", the Mother Moon. A deity whom speaks to them through shamans and speakers."
  nf_ttm.20.d.t: "Recently, a shaman has reached out to me with dire words of warning. Raiders, unlike those of Scorpion's Bite or the Daughters of Hecate march closer to the lands of the tribe. They are known slavers, a people bathed in cruelty and malice. Could these be the same people that hurt poor Hecate's tribe?"
  nf_ttm.20.a.l: "Perhaps its worth a investigation?"
  nf_ttm.20.a.t: "§M"At least its something new, I was growing bored."§!"

  nf_ttm.21.t.l: "The Moon Looked Down On Me"
  nf_ttm.21.d.l: "When we arrived, the tribe's advanced technology, automated defenders and marvellous irrigation system weren't even the most amazing thing.\n\nIt was her, the woman the shamans led us to. Diana.\nA beautiful, terrifying figure larger then any creature in the wasteland with a majestic voice that carried through the chamber effortlessly. Just seeing her could scare someone into faith and submission - the feeling of standing before a true god.\n\nThankfully, Lanius was not a ordinary man - and would not kneel.\nThe two would discuss matters of philosophy, religion, and the future of the wasteland itself for hours."
  nf_ttm.21.a.l: "It was a interesting discussion."
  nf_ttm.21.a.l.tt: "§YTwin Mothers§! will unlock a series of focuses in regards to how to deal with our meeting, whether they will try to give us tribute to avoid conquest, fight back against our influence or even try to work alongside us."

  nf_ttm.21.t.t: "Meeting a Legend"
  nf_ttm.21.d.t: "Eventually, I invited the leader of these raiders, a certain "Lanius" to meet with me deep within Vault-29. My robotic guardians escorted him and his cohorts to the vault, then we had a conversation.\n\n...For one thing, speaking with someone who viewed me with such equality was a strange sensation. I haven't spoken with somebody like this since I had spoken with Hecate, Reese or that prisoner from Tibbet's Prison a few decades ago.\n\nOur talk was enjoyable, I got to pick through Lanius's head a bit - although he is the kind of wasteland sort that seems... driven, the winds of change follow the path he walks. I don't know if I will be able to keep him from attacking my children with gifts alone.\n\nFrom here, my children's survival will depend on how I proceed. I could try to shield my children and tell my shamans to give in to their demands, just as they have the Scorpion's Bite for decades. I could tell our shamans to ready the tribe for war, to try to defend the valley and ensure that others could never steal from our lands again -.. or, if I was to do that I could simply try to emulate what Lanius has done here - embolden my children's spirit and work with the bull, rather then against them."
  nf_ttm.21.a.t: "§M"I always enjoy a new face to speak with."§!"

  nf_ttm.22.t.l: "The Goddess of War?"
  nf_ttm.22.d.l: "Diana, the goddess of the Twin Mothers has made up her mind. She seems willing to try to work "with" the Legion, having been inspired by the power of the Legion. Of course, the idea of even accepting Diana as a partner of the Legion will be controversial - especially with those west of the Rio Grande back at Flagstaff. Not only the fact that she uses technology in her robotic guardians but also in the fact that the Twin Mothers are heavily matriarchal and go against the founding ideals of the Legion itself. Should we accept Diana's aid and the help she will give us, or should we stay true to our Legion ideals?"
  nf_ttm.22.a.l: "We could use the strength of a goddess."
  nf_ttm.22.b.l: "I never believed she was a god anyway."

  nf_ttm.23.t: "A Betrayal!"
  nf_ttm.23.d: "The Legion never wanted to work with me, it seems - instead it is clear that they intend to strike at us. I must rally the tribe if they are to defend themselves against these monsters, even if it pains me that they must abandon their nature."
  nf_ttm.21.a: "§M"Anything to save my children."§!"

  nf_ttm.24.t: "A Gift From The Goddess"
  nf_ttm.24.d: "Diana, surprisingly has come to us with a rather surprising gift. She has offered to supply us with a series of strange machines when used in certain order can transform wasted lands into lush gardens and tranquil forests. The tools of which one can make a world which serves the legion, rather then one the Legion has to work and plough to earn the smallest of meals. Diana offers these at no cost to us, stating that it is merely her wishes to see the beauty of nature return to the world once more. Should we accept this gift?"
  nf_ttm.24.a: "A most kind gift."
  nf_ttm.24.b: "One should work for their worth."
  nf_ttm.24.a.tt: "§gDiana shares with us some of their advanced terraforming technology.§!\nWe unlock a Coring Dice, which is a §Y1d100.§! Every time we core a state we roll the die and gain a effect based on the result.[TTM.ttm_refractoring_radiation_compression_device_coring_effect_scripted_localization][TTM.ttm_geologic_crystal_growth_prism_coring_effect_scripted_localization][TTM.ttm_exponential_humidity_amplifier_system_coring_effect_scripted_localization][TTM.ttm_industrial_hillside_reforesting_network_coring_effect_scripted_localization][TTM.ttm_mass_relay_grassland_expander_coring_effect_scripted_localization]"
  nf_ttm.24.b.tt: "§RDiana will remember this§!\n"

  nf_ttm.25.t.a: "Lanius Accepts"
  nf_ttm.25.d.a: "The Legion thanks us for this kind gift, Lanius promises to use these tools across the east, beginning the slow process of healing the land under his care."
  nf_ttm.25.o.a: "§M"Through Lanius, the world will feel my love."§!"

  nf_ttm.25.t.d: "Lanius Rejects the Gifts"
  nf_ttm.25.d.d: "Oddly enough, our gifts to the legion have been rejected! It seems that Lanius feels that one should work for what they have, that healing the land would make it too easy for the Legion."
  nf_ttm.25.o.d: "§M"They don't feel that the world should be healed?"§!"

  nf_ttm.26.t: "Ash from the Goddess"
  nf_ttm.26.d: "Recently, Diana has told us that they have opened up a supply line between our lands and La Garita. We will now have all of the ash we need to build proper old world concrete!"
  nf_ttm.26.a: "With this, we can build an empire."

  nf_ttm.27.t: "Carpe Diem"
  nf_ttm.27.d: "And so, just as Athens did to the Romans we have chosen to surrender our peoples beliefs in favour of another. Yet, thankfully it was under our terms - not theirs. If Lanius wants a ally we will give them one - it will be a mutual alliance, not one of submission or domination.\nPerhaps this is a lesson to teach my people - that you should stand up for yourself, rather then letting others walk over you."
  nf_ttm.27.a: "§M"I guess the saying goes "When in Rome", right?"§!"

  nf_ttm.28.t: "The Cult of Diana"
  nf_ttm.28.d: "An ocean away, over twenty five hundred years ago the Cult of Diana first spread out from Diana's Mirror, south of the mythical Alpine mountains. There, she echoed much from the old deity "Artemis" and became a patroness of the countryside, hunters, crossroads and the Moon. Among the legion we can now start this faith once again, taking on the face of Diana as Diana once did to Artemis, continuing a tradition unbroken for millennia."
  nf_ttm.28.a: "§M"Veni, vidi, vici"§!"

  nf_ttm.29.t: "Till Death Do Us Part?"
  nf_ttm.29.d: "There is, to be frank some amount of cultural divide between the Twin Mothers tribe and the rest of the Legion.\nFrom simple things, such as my children’s use of robotics to their general demeanour. They have tried to remedy some of these - but in truth it might be impossible for the Legion to truly accept them unless we do something drastic.\n\nAfter all, if they cannot accept the tribe then I can never hope to use the Legion to help heal the wastes.\n\nPerhaps, if I were to stage a ‘marriage’ between myself, the deity and Lanius, the mortal that might be enough? It would certainly improve Lanius’s prestige - but it would also improve my own and help cement my children as a vital part of the Legion’s inner working.."
  nf_ttm.29.a: "§M"Lets see how Lanius thinks"§!"
  nf_ttm.29.b: "§M"We need to do this on our own."§!"

  nf_ttm.30.t: "Till Death Do Us Part?"
  nf_ttm.30.d: "Diana has proposed to us a rather.. Interesting idea. She has complained of difficulties getting the Legion to see her tribe as equals. To remedy this Diana has proposed a “marriage” between herself and Lanius - with this, she can get her tribe accepted among the Legion easily.\n\nOf course, this would be something that would raise Lanius’s own prestige among the Legion as well. Would it be something we are interested in?"
  nf_ttm.30.a: "If it would make her life easier..."
  nf_ttm.30.a.tt: "We "marry" Diana, while there will be no formal ceremony there will be much talk of this among the Legion.\n"
  nf_ttm.30.b: "Sorry, already taken."
  nf_ttm.30.b.tt: "We reject Diana, but she will probably understand."

  nf_ttm.31.t.a: "Till Death Do Us Part."
  nf_ttm.31.d.a: "Lanius has accepted my proposal. While there will be no formal ceremony between us both my children and the people of the Legion will speak of this for years to come. It will help the greater Legion become aware of me and respect me as a deity worth respect."
  nf_ttm.31.o.a: "§M"I do enjoy a fun little gambit."§!"

  nf_ttm.31.t.d: "Rejection"
  nf_ttm.31.d.d: "Lanius has stated that this is probably a bad idea for us, as he is a bad fit for our personality and that he is already taken."
  nf_ttm.31.o.d: "§M"I guess we will do this on our own."§!"

  nf_ttm.31.t: "The Twin Mothers prepare for war."
  nf_ttm.31.d: "It seems our talk with Diana wasn't enough to sway the Twin Mothers to our side. The tribe has begun the process of preparing for war to defend against a possible invasion from us."
  nf_ttm.31.a: "Another conquest, it seems.."

  nf_ttm.32.t: "The Twin Mothers offer a white peace?"
  nf_ttm.32.d: "The Twin Mothers have presented us an offer - saying that they will agree to return to their valley if we promise to leave them alone and end this conflict."
  nf_ttm.32.a.a: "Accept it - we can attack them when we regroup"
  nf_ttm.32.d.d: "Decline, continue the war!"

  nf_ttm.33.t.d: "Lanius Refuses!"
  nf_ttm.33.d.d: "It seems the Legion wants to carry this war out to the very end."
  nf_ttm.33.o.d: "§M"Very well, we will play this game a while longer."§!"

  nf_ttm.33.t.a: "Lanius Accepts!"
  nf_ttm.33.d.a: "The Legion has agreed to pull off of our borders and end the war. It seems our tribe has been spared the cost of war."
  nf_ttm.33.o.a: "§M"Peace is a valued treasure in the wasteland."§!"

  nf_ttm.35.t: "Twin Mothers Offers Tribute"
  nf_ttm.35.d: "Diana has offered us a gift! A collection of valuable metals and resources. She says that more good will come to the Legion if we choose to work with the Twin Mothers, rather then against them."
  nf_ttm.35.a: "Tribute is nice.."
  nf_ttm.35.b: "Take the gifts, but insist we will still conquer them."  
  
  nf_ttm.36.t: "The Twin Mothers Flee North!"
  nf_ttm.36.d: "The Twin Mothers as a tribe have seemed to have taught their last lesson - Lanius's forces filling the valley and taking control of their sacred temples and fields. When the time came to finally bring Diana herself out for questioning the Legion was left empty handed.\nDiana would have opened up her true home in "Paradise" to wastelanders and Twin Mothers refugees, seeking to heal from the injuries they took and prepare for a defence against further Legionary attacks."
  nf_ttm.36.a.t: "§M"So many of my children lost..."§!"
  nf_ttm.36.a.t_tt: "§gDian never ruled from the southern Twin Mothers territory, but up in the far north - in Paradise. With the fall of the Twin Mothers Diana has been left with no other choice but to open up the Nursery, allowing refugees to travel north to re-inhabit her true home.§!"

  nf_ttm.36.a.o_tt: "It turns out that §YDiana§! has been ruling from §YParadise§! state this whole time inside of something called the "Nursery". The Twin Mothers presence here has taken our control away from this land! We need to get this land back!"

  nf_ttm.37.t: "The Realm of Diana"
  nf_ttm.37.d: "Our battle against the Legion has hardened our tribes resolve - gone are the days of peace, love and tranquillity. The wasteland is a harsh place and enemies to the Twin Mothers must be dismantled so that they can never hurt the tribe again. The tribe has to grow, evolve if it hopes to thrive in the wasteland with monsters such as Lanius."
  nf_ttm.37.a: "§M"Our victory has made us stronger"§!"
  nf_ttm.37.b: "§M"We will retake back our home, someday"§!" 

  nf_ttm.38.t: "Diana Demands Colorado!"
  nf_ttm.38.d: "Diana has recently given us a rather dire ultimatum - that we ever hand over every state we own in Colorado, or to be destroyed and have our conquests liberated. This is a ridiculous offer that we can never accept!"
  nf_ttm.38.a: "Who cares about Colorado when you can live in Texas."
  nf_ttm.38.b: "Outright refuse."

  nf_ttm.39.t.b: "Lanius refuses!"
  nf_ttm.39.d.b: "Of course, we were expecting this from the monster of the east. It seems we will have to liberate Colorado ourselves."
  nf_ttm.39.b: "§M"Lets hope Lanius is prepared for my fury."§!"

  nf_ttm.40.t: "Traders Arrive From Colorado!"
  nf_ttm.40.d: "Recently a group of strange tribals have arrived in our lands, having ventured long and far across the Colorado river to get here! They claim to be from the "Twin Mothers" tribe, a tribe which believes in the divinity of the Goddess "Diana". The Twin Mothers wish to open up a embassy in our lands - offering goods and services in exchange for knowledge and caps."
  nf_ttm.40.a: "A mutually beneficial transaction"

  nf_ttm.41.t: "Slaves Suffer in the Legion!"
  nf_ttm.41.d: "It seems that Lanius wasn't completely honest with us about just how cruelly they treated the slaves. They force them to build camps, roads - essentially treating them as tamed beasts! Some in the tribe feel that we cannot abide by this injustice!"
  nf_ttm.41.a: "§M"I will have to act carefully..."§!"

  nf_ttm.42.t: "A Paradise for Slaves"
  nf_ttm.42.d: "We have taken in a great deal of slaves in from the Legion's lands to Paradise. Here, they can live to their maximum content in these eternal gardens.\nYet.. some don't seem so eager to simply sit about and relax. Others seem to harbour anger towards the Legion for what they did to them - they seem to be organizing?"
  nf_ttm.42.a: "§M"Lets let them enjoy their freedom."§!"

  nf_ttm.43.t: "An Army of Freemen"
  nf_ttm.43.d: "The slaves we have brought in from the Legion have organized, forming small fighting circles built around protecting us from Lanius. If we ever were to turn our backs on Lanius these slaves would be instrumental in such a conflict."

  nf_ttm.44.t: "The Matter of ZAX - 29"
  nf_ttm.44.d: "ZAX - 29 is our link to the Twin Mothers tribe itself, through it we are able to link up and establish influence over the tribe, leading it from afar. For a long while we have merely been controlling ZAX - 29 from afar, sending them instructions on how best to lead the tribe.. However, now we are approaching the point where we have to question how necessary he is to our rulership. We could try to remove the ZAX's personality so that its easier to communicate with the tribe - or we could try to further its personality so that it is a more efficient steward for the tribe."

If what I am hearing is true it seems that after he stole this G.E.C.K. he took it south, using it to spread terrible, mutated fauna across the area of former New Mexico and Texas. It finally ended up in the state of Eden - taken there after being pulled from Reese's infected, mutated flesh in Corpus Christi.\nThe G.E.C.K. has been well defended for years - until now, when a group of invaders took over the region and made it - and that G.E.C.K. their own."

I remember stories of him helping vaulters defeat mutants to the west, help tribals stop corrupt pre-war regimes and even moving to Los for a time.

  nf_ttm.57.d: "Memories flood back to me, of someone I had forgotten.\nThey were the student, of Hecate. I was the one that gave them that name, that put them on the path they are on now. At one point, before they were Hecate they were just a scared, sick raider. I brought them back to health, told them of a potential future they could attain for themselves, taught them of the potential of biological genetics and the path to healing the wasteland. They seemed to take my ideas to heart!"

  nf_ttm.58.t: "Memories of Family"
  nf_ttm.58.d: "Memories flood back to me, of someone I had forgotten.\nThey were.. of my family. Greenway was a ingenious man, one who helped me when nobody else could to keep me alive when my body had started to fail me. He stripped me of my humanity in able to turn me into a god-... yet, I wasn't Greenway's sole project. Another, a massive AI project - one to rival Poseidon Energy's governmental projects - was done with the help of Greenway as well. This AI would be known as ODYSSEUS, a massive entity who once ran the Tibbet's Prison facility to the west. Sadly, it seems that ODYSSEUS is no more - having been destroyed in a Brotherhood of Steel raid.. But perhaps there is a way I might be able to still meet him, now that I have recovered my memory."

 nf_mot.4.t:9 "Skirmishes with the Mojave Brotherhood of Steel"
 nf_mot.4.d:9 "When we first came to the Mojave, we discovered a chapter of the Brotherhood of Steel carrying out technology raids across the wastelands. They were far from home, and led by a somewhat fanatical and unpredictable chapter leader: Elijah. In the early days of our campaign we clashed with them on numerous occasions, but both sides knew the Mojave Chapter had neither the manpower nor equipment to contest our control of the majority of the Mojave. Instead, the Brotherhood took up residence on the site of HELIOS One, a pre-war solar array filled to the brim with the kind of ancient technology the Brotherhood obsess over.\n\nThe unstable status quo that settled into the Mojave can't last forever, even if both sides would lose from a prolonged conflict. However, under political pressure from Shady Sands, we've begun military preparations for §OOperation: Sunburst§!: a large-scale assault on HELIOS One with the intent of securing it for the Republic and wiping the Brotherhood from the Mojave. Noticing our preparations, the Brotherhood have started preparing too for the inevitable conflict. The balance of power between our two nations can be seen from our §OPreperation§!: the more preparation we have over the Brotherhood, the more effective our troops will be. The relatively small scale of the Operation means that every bit of preparation matters!"
 nf_mot.4.a:9 "Weakening their ability to perform requisition raids must be a priority."
 nf_mot.4.b:9 "We need to get to know them better, first of all."
 nf_mot.4.c:9 "Our only option is to destroy them. Make preparations."
 nf_mot.5.t:9 "Defending the Mojave"
 nf_mot.5.d:9 "While the Mojave Chapter may be defeated, and we seem to be temporarily safe from foreign threats, a sense of unease still settles over Mojave Defence Committee. Formed of the most talented military minds the Mojave Campaign has to offer, it offers advice for overall strategy to General Oliver, who has the final say on all military decisions within the Mojave. The Committee has always quietly grumbled about Oliver overriding many of their recommendations in favour of bold, flashy and prestigious offensives, but they are all loyal to the Republic and respect its chain of command. Following orders and disagreeing with them are very different things, however, and over recent months Ranger Chief Hanlon has begun to voice his discontent at Oliver's tactics, arguing a more cautious approach would save lives: a view which is echoed by others on the Committee. The two will surely have disagreements going forwards, especially as war approaches once more."
 nf_mot.5.a:9 "We need to keep an eye on this dispute..."
 nf_mot.6.t:9 "Supplying the Mojave"
 nf_mot.6.d:9 "The Mojave was far from hospitable terrain before the Great War. After it, great swathes of the Mojave became scorching, radiation-filled deserts. Movement of troops and civilians is difficult, and largely restricted to two major trade routes: Route 95 and the I-15. Even more difficult is the movement of supplies. Caravans are slow and bulky, and often have to navigate off established trade routes to reach outposts and garrisons in strategic, rather than convenient, locations. While we had enough supply to support the establishment and expansion of our current outposts, any future efforts to expand upon, resupply or establish bases will require the investment of supply. \n\nWe can gain supply through concerted efforts to do in our focus tree, or through negotiating for it from the NCR government. It can be used for various projects, available later in our focus tree."
 nf_mot.6.a:9 "Compromises may need to be made."
 nf_mot.7.t:9 "The Great Khans attack Camp McCarran"
 nf_mot.7.d:9 "The Great Khans, a tribal group that has resided in the Mojave Wastes for years after being expelled from California, has long been a thorn in our side. Since our arrival in the Mojave, we have been in constant clashes with their forces wherever our troops are garrisoned. Their warrior culture is incredibly strong, and they make good wariors as a result, costing us dearly in skirmishes. Over recent days, however, their attacks have increased in frequency. Today, this came to a head when an entire Khan Warband launched an assault on Camp McCarran. \n\nThe attack left a bloody toll on both sides, with our troopers being forced to abandon much of the courtyard and retreat into the main terminal. It was only thanks to Rangers hastily redeployed from the Hoover Dam that the Khan advance into the camp was halted. Sensing their momentum had run out, the Khans made a quick retreat, taking a significant number of supplies in the process. It seems the Khans will become a real issue..."
 nf_mot.7.a:9 "This must not happen again."

 nf_mot_news.1.t:9 "Operation: Sunburst"
 nf_mot_news.1.d:9 "Early this morning, the Mojave Expedition of the New California Republic launched an offensive against the Mojave Chapter of the Brotherhood of Steel. Codenamed 'Operation: Sunburst', the offensive comes after months of preparation work by both sides. Despite enjoying numerical superiority, the Mojave Expedition is outmatched in training and technology by the Brotherhood, meaning the fight may be closer than either side would like. Whatever the outcome, the future of the Mojave will be sculpted by the result."
 nf_mot_news.1.a:9 "The Brotherhood is a threat to peace and democracy!"
 nf_mot_news.1.b:9 "Our technology must be defended against this brazen imperialism!"

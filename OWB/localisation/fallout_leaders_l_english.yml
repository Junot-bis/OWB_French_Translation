  IMMORTAL_DESC:0 "Revered by his subordinates for leading them across the midwest to Seattle, the so called 'Immortal' Elder is older than even his most senior commanders. His campaign of violence and subjugation throughout Washington has inspired a lust for blood in his chapter - leaving a black stain on the Brotherhood as a whole."
  CHOSEN_DESC:0 "Legendary among their people for accomplishing the task of finding a G.E.C.K., saving them from the Enclave, and reuniting the two bloodlines - the Chosen One is worthy of being called a hero. New Arroyo thrives under their leadership, having become a powerful and peaceful nation."

Unfortunately for the wasteland, Michael considers everyone a sinner."
  OLDDOG_DESC:0 "The so called "king" of the Withered Dogs, Old Dog is a ghoul gone almost completely feral.

  PALM_DESC:0 "Formerly a Centurion maintaining a garrison in Arizona, Palm re-established his tribe after the fall of the Legion. Raised along the I-10 for most of their lives, the 10 Signs were mercilessly integrated into the Legion during its early growth period.

Whether or not his citizens will let him live long enough to fulfil these promises is debatable."
  WAUBA_DESC:0 "Wauba's tribe was one of the first absorbed into the Legion, their culture wiped clean by Caesar's men to make them part of his own.

When the dust settled and the Legion was gone, Taklishim wasn't a vagabond any more: he was a leader."
  HONEST_DESC:0 "Mechanics are few and far between in the wasteland, especially in tribes. Honest was given breathing room by the Legion in return for his services as a mechanic, which he exploited as much as possible.

  RAGNAR_DESC:0 "Son of the Frost—that's what they call Ragnar. Legends speak of his birth, the child of a dead man and a frost giant from the Endless White. Supposedly only the Frozen Cabal knows the true story. Regardless of myth, Ragnar's might is clear to see, he stands taller and broader than any other man along the coast. He lives and breathes \"Survival of the Fittest\". Seven foot tall and seemingly invincible, Ragnar's thirst for battle is only matched by his inhuman strength."

  QUEEN_VICTORIA_DESC:0 "The ruling monarch of New Victoria, named after her domain as her mothers before her were, Queen Victoria has served her people well during her time upon the throne. Although her bloodline has no connection to the Windsors, their ancestory can be traced back to an influential Canadian politician. Not considering itself a British successor, but rather a Canadian Monarchy, the royal house of New Victoria continues traditions most have forgotten."

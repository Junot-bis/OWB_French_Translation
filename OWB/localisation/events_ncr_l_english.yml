  ncr.1.t: "The Boomers"
  ncr.1.d: "The Boomers would be an effective ally in Vegas, and their artillery would be invaluable in our defence of Hoover Dam. We should attempt to ally with them, or we may have to take their artillery by force."
  ncr.1.a: "Send a diplomat."
  ncr.1.b: "They would not ally with us."

  ncr.2.t: "The Great Khans"
  ncr.2.d: "The Great Khans have been an enemy of the NCR for ages, and seem to want to ally themselves with Caesar. We can change this diplomatically, if the right leadership is installed, or we can preemptively destroy the Khans."
  ncr.2.a: "A sympathetic leader is installed."
  ncr.2.b: "It is not worth the risk."

  ncr.3.t: "New Vegas"
  ncr.3.d: "Mr House is a wild card, and his own eyes are set on Hoover Dam. Though he has been good to the NCR, he is an enemy of the Republic, and he must be removed from power if we are to succeed. If we sponsor NCR rule in New Vegas they can join us peacefully, otherwise we will need to remove him violently."
  ncr.3.a: "Vegas will join us."
  ncr.3.b: "We must remove all our enemies."

  ncr.4.t: "The Brotherhood"
  ncr.4.d: "We have discovered that the Brotherhood of Steel, who we have warred with in the past, still has an outpost in the Mojave. This is an enemy that must be removed before we can take the Mojave, either diplomatically or violently."
  ncr.4.a: "I choose peace."
  ncr.4.b: "They must be destroyed."

  ncr-boswar.1.t: "NCR Patrol Report"
  ncr-boswar.1.d: "Recently an NCR patrol found a large group of Brotherhood soldiers and scribes inhabiting a building in the heart of the Boneyard. Attempts to figure out what they're doing have been fruitless. When asked to leave, they declined - violently. Already a few NCR soldiers have died for \"trespassing\", and we're reaching a breaking point."
  ncr-boswar.1.a: "Send a messenger"
  ncr-boswar.1.b: "Storm the building"

  ncr-boswar.2.t: "NCR Messenger"
  ncr-boswar.2.d: "In the early hours of the morning a man approached the sealed doors of one of our bunkers near NCR territory. He claims to be a messenger sent by the Californian brass, and so we took his message and told him to await our reply. The NCR are accusing us of sending a Brotherhood patrol to the Boneyard, without their permission. They made it especially clear that the patrol has already killed many NCR soldiers."
  ncr-boswar.2.a: "Tell them they were acting without orders"
  ncr-boswar.2.b: "Tell the NCR to return our men"

  ncr-boswar.3.t: "Scene Of Battle"
  ncr-boswar.3.d: "A month ago a large group of our soldiers went missing with a small contingent of Scribes. After much searching we finally found them thanks to a distress signal. We arrived at the scene of a bloody battle, with laser burns and bullet holes across the entire building. We searched the ruin for any signs of technology, or survivors, and found nothing... nothing except a few pairs of NCR dog tags lost under the rubble."
  ncr-boswar.3.a: "This is an outrage!"
  ncr-boswar.3.b: "We don't want to poke the bear"

  ncr-boswar.4.t: "Brotherhood Response"
  ncr-boswar.4.d: "Our messenger has come back to us shaken, but unharmed. The message he carries from the Brotherhood is blunt and to the point. \"Our soldiers were acting without orders, they must have gone AWOL over something important.\" Whether we believe them or not, one thing is certain: the Brotherhood soldiers we found were in a West-Tek facility."
  ncr-boswar.4.a: "Extend an olive branch"
  ncr-boswar.4.b: "We can't trust them"

  ncr-boswar.5.t: "All-Good Murphy"
  ncr-boswar.5.d: "Returning to us in the late evening our messenger came shaken and bearing bad news. The Brotherhood are outraged at our suggestion that they caused this crisis, and furthermore, demand that we send their troops back unharmed. President Wendell Peterson was reaching a breaking point, but one of the senators, a man by the name of Sean All-Good Murphy stepped in to calm the President."
  ncr-boswar.5.a: "Send him to the Brotherhood"

  ncr-boswar.6.t: "Brotherhood Response"
  ncr-boswar.6.d: "Returning to us in the late evening our messenger came shaken and bearing bad news. The Brotherhood are outraged at our suggestion that they caused this crisis, and furthermore, demand that we send their troops back unharmed. President Wendell Peterson crushed the message in the ball of his fist in rage. The audacity!"
  ncr-boswar.6.a: "Mobilise the army!"

  ncr-boswar.7.t: "Scouting Party Returns"
  ncr-boswar.7.d: "We've received word from our AWOL soldiers that the NCR allowed them to leave the Boneyard without complications. Supposedly they're bringing some seven holotapes of unknown value back with them; but since they're from a West-Tek facility they will be invaluable to our efforts to understand and preserve technology."
  ncr-boswar.7.a: "Punish them for acting without orders"

  ncr-boswar.8.t: "The Ultimatum"
  ncr-boswar.8.d: "We've been given an ultimatum by the NCR. Either we give them compensation for the deaths of their soldiers, or there will be \"repercussions\". "
  ncr-boswar.8.a: "Pay the compensation"
  ncr-boswar.8.b: "Compensation? For what?"

  ncr-boswar.9.t: "All-Good Returns"
  ncr-boswar.9.d: "Our demands have not gone unnoticed. The NCR have sent All-Good to speak with us once again. As ever he came to us nervous but undaunted, and we began to discuss the current situation. Sean stresses that he was only barely able to keep the NCR from declaring all-out war for our \"hubris\" and seeks to find a compromise. "
  ncr-boswar.9.a: "We must find a peaceful solution"
  ncr-boswar.9.b: "We must have our men returned"

  ncr-boswar.10.t: "All-Good Murphy"
  ncr-boswar.10.d: "The Brotherhood have refused to compensate our losses rather harshly. President Wendell Peterson flew into a fit of fury, but a senator by the name of Sean Murphy stepped forward to calm him. This man, \"All-Good\", proposed simply letting the soldiers go. He knows the Brotherhood, and made a convincing argument that open conflict would put the NCR through a gauntlet it could entirely avoid."
  ncr-boswar.10.a: "We can't risk a war"

  ncr-boswar.11.t: "Brotherhood Refusal"
  ncr-boswar.11.d: "The Brotherhood have refused to compensate our losses rather harshly. President Wendell Peterson is outraged at the continued audacity of the Brotherhood, and nobody steps forward to offer any kind of alternatives."
  ncr-boswar.11.a: "To hell with diplomacy!"

  ncr-boswar.12.t: "Successful Mission"
  ncr-boswar.12.d: "All-Good returned from the Brotherhood optimistically. They're willing to find a compromise to the issue as long as it's reasonable, and Sean is telling us to take them up on this offer. He suggests we ask the Brotherhood to detain their soldiers who killed our soldiers, for a number of years they find reasonable, and they can keep the rest. All we need, he says, is justice for our dead soldiers."
  ncr-boswar.12.a: "Hopefully the Brotherhood keep their end"
  ncr-boswar.12.b: "No repercussions? To hell with that!"

  ncr-boswar.13.t: "Diplomacy Wins Out"
  ncr-boswar.13.d: "We've received word that the Brotherhood have sentenced the soldiers responsible for killing our men. Five years for one man, and two for the other three. The Brotherhood have sent a formal thank you to us for allowing them to carry out the sentence."
  ncr-boswar.13.a: "The sentences are too short, but at least we avoided more bloodshed"

  ncr-boswar.14.t: "Negotiations Break Down"
  ncr-boswar.14.d: "Negotiations have broken down with the NCR. All-Good sent us a message ahead of time informing us of the worst, and the Elders are demanding the NCR be silenced once and for all."
  ncr-boswar.14.a: "The NCR were responsible for their own destruction"

  ncr-boswar.15.t: "Demand Helios One"
  ncr-boswar.15.d: "With the breakdown in diplomacy with the Brotherhood of Steel we should demand Helios One and Route 95 from the Mojave Brotherhood or threat them with war!"
  ncr-boswar.15.a: "Send the demands."

  ncr-boswar.16.t: "NCR Demands Helios One"
  ncr-boswar.16.d: "In the NCR's audacity of not only being at war with the Brotherhood they now demand Helios One and Route 95 from us and if we don't deliver they threaten us with war! Should we give in to these demands?"
  ncr-boswar.16.a: "Give them what they want."
  ncr-boswar.16.b: "They'll have to take it by force!"

  nf_ncr.1.t: "The Beloved Of The Republic"
  nf_ncr.1.d: "Among the historical records of the NCR, there are a number of figures that stand out as quintessential to the republic, yet who among them is most celebrated in propaganda and education? Who shall appear on the most important pieces of currency, be mentioned in speeches, and stand above the rest as the figurehead of the NCR? The three essential figures in the history of the NCR are thus: "
  nf_ncr.1.a: "Aradesh, the founder and father of the NCR."
  nf_ncr.1.b: "Seth, the First Ranger, the NCR's greatest war hero."
  nf_ncr.1.c: "Tandi, Mother of the Republic."

  nf_ncr.2.t: "~The Baja Blues~"
  nf_ncr.2.d: " In the year 2256, the NCR Colony of Rattletail was established in the northern portion of Baja California by some volunteer colonists, who advanced with formal funding and merit from the NCR, but with little to no supervision or military protection. This choice would prove almost fatal for the young colonists, who elected to, by force, take control over the primary water source in the region, a fact that they were ignorant to at the time. \n\n   The locals retaliated against the small settlement, due in part to desperation, and launched two major assaults against the township, both of which were stopped with relative ease. It was the intervention and wisdom of a young Ranger, named Hanlon, that ended the dispute before the toll of the conflict became notable. The man crafted a clever lie, spouting nonsense about an army of raiders that would soon come and wipe the town away. The colonists evacuated, the locals regained their water-supply, and greater conflict was avoided. \n\n   Unfortunately, this lie had an unintended result. It implanted, in the locals, the notion that the NCR was afraid of raiders, slavers, and the other violent sort. The locals of Baja have had almost a decade to prepare for the return of the NCR, and in preparation for that coming, they have adopted a violent, cruel lifestyle. Baja is now home to an up and coming Mexican Cartel, one that will be almost impossible to dislodge without violence. The path into the future is a complicated one, and there are only a handful of men in the NCR who have the potential to deal with this problem. Who do you appoint to oversee the handling of Baja the Baja Frontier?"
  nf_ncr.2.a: "Ranger Chief Hanlon, the Heavy Hand."
  nf_ncr.2.b: "Héctor Santángel, the Local Sympathizer."
  nf_ncr.2.c: "Grant C. Hayes, the Mayor of Dayglow."

  nf_ncr.3.t: "~The Baron's War!~"
  nf_ncr.3.d: "  There is no misunderstanding within the NCR as to which border is the weakest, for the northern lands of the NCR haven't seen large-scale military action or involvement since the NCR-80's War, almost ten years ago. It was during this time that many vulnerabilities within the NCR became clear, not the least of which was the substantial time it can take for the NCR to mobilize and move its military north. \n\n  When faced with the realization that the NCR's military was largely incapable of protecting or patrolling the rural northern reaches of the nation, the many influential and wealthy Brahmin Baron's took to protecting their own property with private military forces. Dozens and sometimes hundreds of mercenaries, being paid to patrol acres of grazing land, and to fight off rustlers. While initially harmless, the situation has grown more dangerous in recent years, as Baron's have taken to engaging in endless skirmishes with one another for land Brahmin, while using their political clout to keep local law enforcement off their backs. \n\n  And yet something has happened that no amount of clout can hide. The Poker family, a group of Baron's past their prime, openly murdered their prime rivals on the streets of Sacramento in a gunfight involving no fewer than fifty men and resulted in numerous civilian casualties. This event ignited a powder keg of infight among the Baron's, who now sent thousands of mercenaries to raid each other's holdings in the countryside and in various towns. Dozens of civilians have died, and an unprecedented amount of property damage has been dealt. What's more, the flow of food to the densely populated urban regions of the NCR has all but stopped. This is a disaster that must be brought under control before starvation sets in."
  nf_ncr.3.a: "This is a disaster!"

  nf_ncr.4.t: "The Emergency Council."
  nf_ncr.4.d: "The situation in the north has thrown the entire NCR into chaos, and dozens are dying each day. There is only so much that can be done on short notice, and even as troops are being shipped north. In an attempt to bring an end to the chaos, many powerful NCR politicians and military commanders have formed an emergency council to handle the situation. Yet even now the council has fallen to infighting, with the two most powerful political figures present, Anton I. Flynn and Sean \"Allgood\" Murphy clashing during every encounter. Flynn believes that the easiest method of dealing with the situation is to simply hire the mercenaries employed by all Baron's and to redistribute the land of the more violent Barons to loyal ones, such as himself. Murphy, however, believes that this is simply a power play on Flynn's part, and thinks the answer lies with outside help. Namely, the Brotherhood of Steel, who used to patrol and protect the region. The Military commanders present aren't fond of either plan and even now, consider ignoring the council to take decisive action."

  nf_ncr.4.b: "Allgood Murphy's Diplomatic Mission"
  nf_ncr.4.c: "Military Intervention"

  nf_ncr.5.t: "Fleeing Barons!"
  nf_ncr.5.d: "When faced with large scale arrests and criminal prosecution, the vast majority of guilty NCR Barons have elected to take their wealth and flee to neighbouring communities! Their has come to us as a result."
  nf_ncr.5.a: "More for us!"

  nf_ncr.6.t: "Wendell Peterson's War."
  nf_ncr.6.d: "Wendell Peterson believes, above all other things, that the future of the NCR lies in the frontier, Raiders, Tribals and Paladins be damned. To this end, he has spent much of his first year in office drumming up support for the ambitious Frontier Expedition, which is meant to bring as much of California under the NCR's control as possible. Yet in order to make such a dream a reality, he is going to have to deal with various political parties. Each pushes their own agenda, and each wants to put their own figurehead in the most ambitious post in the NCR's military. Yet it is only with this support that Peterson can gain the congressional votes he needs to launch the Expedition."
  nf_ncr.6.a: "General Drummond, Hero of Navarro, the Military's Choice"
  nf_ncr.6.b: "Big Jim Marshal, Hero of Nevada, the Baron's Choice"
  nf_ncr.6.c: "Mossman, the Unassuming Ranger, Dayglow's Choice"

  nf_ncr.7.t: "The NCR ultimatum!"
  nf_ncr.7.d: "The NCR threatens Baja! They demand the various gangs and militias both disband and turn in all arms! We'll show them what it means to threaten the People of Baja."
  nf_ncr.7.a: "How dare they!"

  nf_ncr.8.t: "The Baja Integration Act."
  nf_ncr.8.d: "The Efforts of Grant C. Hayes have finally born fruit, for innumerable bribes and efforts to placate the various raiders of Baja California have resulted in what can largely be considered a success. The various gangs are at our tables, offering to both disarm and unify under the umbrella of the NCR, in exchange for further funding and most importantly, the ability to gain protection from the central government of the NCR. All is well and the integration act seems to be going as planned! Yet the peace talks are… delicate, and it would take only the smallest offence to push the gangs of Baja back into violence. Yet who would want that?"
  nf_ncr.8.a: "Violence has been averted, and peace will come to Baja at last."
  nf_ncr.8.b: "This was a ploy to save face! Raiders have no place in the Republic."

  nf_ncr.9.t: "Rapids Exiled."
  nf_ncr.9.d: "The NCR has made a foolish move in their attempts to control the riverbanks of the Colorado, evicting the once powerful Rapids Tribes from their ancestral homelands. They have come to us in their thousands, bringing with them ships and supplies, eager warriors who now seek revenge against the NCR for taking their homelands. In time their culture shall be broken and their people shall become one with us, but until then? Let us enjoy our new fleet."
  nf_ncr.9.a: "The Colorado shall be ours!"

  nf_ncr.10.t: "The Mother's Lessons"
  nf_ncr.10.d: "Tandi devoted her life to the cause of the New California Republic, and early in her life, her ideals faded and she was faced with honest pragmatism. She made a series of hard choices, many of which did not necessarily earn her the adoration of her people. Of the choices Tandi made, the most notable are: "
  nf_ncr.10.a: "The Nevada Trade Agreements."
  nf_ncr.10.b: "The Water Redistribution Act."
  nf_ncr.10.c: "The NCR Draft."

  nf_ncr.11.t: "NCR Investments"
  nf_ncr.11.d: "The NCR development plan was one of the most hotly debated subjects in NCR political history, as it called for a centralization of what had up until that point, been a largely diverse agricultural nation. The debate raged for months as to whether or not to even bother with this plan, but eventually it was decided that the bill should focus on the development of a specific area of the economy. Be it the reconstruction of roads, subsidising select local businesses, or additional funding towards arms manufacturing."
  nf_ncr.11.a: "Subsidize local business."
  nf_ncr.11.b: "Fund armament manufacturing."
  nf_ncr.11.c: "Improve the infrastructure."

  nf_ncr.12.t: "Battle Of Navarro"
  nf_ncr.12.d: "On the Eve of the final assault, the acting General of the NCR’s Army, Alexander Drummond, received a personal visit from the president herself. Tandi made it clear to him that the NCR could not afford a slaughter, and advised him to hold back the majority of his troops during the assault. Meanwhile, the commander of the Brotherhood of Steel had already gone and approved Plans with Drummond, a joint attack that was dependant on the NCR providing a sizeable distraction. All the while, Drummond had grown increasingly frustrated with the entire situation and knew that he might regain much of his lost honour if he ordered an overwhelming charge, and claimed the majority of Navarro's treasures for the NCR, a reckless move that could save his career."
  nf_ncr.12.a: "He held back our troops."
  nf_ncr.12.b: "He committed to the Brotherhood's plan."
  nf_ncr.12.c: "He recklessly pushed for an overwhelming NCR assault."

  nf_ncr.13.t: "Deadlock at the polls?"
  nf_ncr.13.d: "The NCR election teeters on the edge of disaster, for never before has the republic been so divided! The cumulative tests such as the Legion and Brotherhood of Steel have aroused a staunch anti-war stance from many of the NCR’s states, which has in turn damaged trust in the central government of the republic and its military. The Brahmin Baron’s, who have flocked to the side of presidential candidate Anton Flynn, squabble for power after their recent disasters. Meanwhile, Allgood Murphy Preaches fire and Brimstone against the Warlike Aaron Kimball, going so far as to threaten bringing the Brotherhood of Steel into any potential conflict. Meanwhile, the charismatic Grant C. Hayes has corned the vote in the state of Dayglow, and his shadowy allies begin to make their move all across the republic. It is very possible that the election may end up being utterly inconclusive! A nightmare event in the eyes of many. Will the Republic survive?"
  nf_ncr.13.a: "The Barons should take control"
  nf_ncr.13.b: "Allgood Murphy should take control"
  nf_ncr.13.c: "Dayglow is the future"
  nf_ncr.13.e: "General Drummond shall seize the republic"
  nf_ncr.13.f: "Kimball is the way"
  nf_ncr.13.g: "Is this the end of the Republic?"

  nf_ncr.16.t: "Take me out to the Ballgame."
  nf_ncr.16.d: "The first of the NCR's official baseball seasons has finally begun! Thousands flock to stadiums even as thousands more tune in to listen on the radio. All teams are beloved, but there are three that stand above all others as actual contenders capable of winning this legendary season. The Old Sluggers, an all ghoul team that includes a number of pre-war athletes; The 118th regiment, a selection of the finest veterans from the Mojave Campaign; and the Atoms, a surprisingly successful team that has the financial backing of Hayes and his political party."
  nf_ncr.16.a: "The Old Sluggers, old school ghouls with old school rules."
  nf_ncr.16.b: "The 118th Regiment, new heroes for the people of the republic."
  nf_ncr.16.c: "The Atoms, knights of yore armed with bats of ash and hickory."

  nf_ncr.17.t: "Sac City Investments."
  nf_ncr.17.d: "The Barons of Northern California might actually know what it means to have all the money in the world, as their collective wealth exceeds the budget of even the mighty NCR. When they put their minds and their bottle caps to a task, there is very little they can't achieve. A strong example of this might be their efforts to gain more direct control over Sac City."
  nf_ncr.17.a: "The hostile takeover of of Sac City's small businesses."
  nf_ncr.17.b: "The acquisition of local crimes, gangs and raider groups."
  nf_ncr.17.c: "The bribery and direct control of the Sac City Police."

  nf_ncr.18.t: "Scouring the Old City."
  nf_ncr.18.d: "The City of Los Angeles once held some of the greatest technology and people in all of the old world, and the acquisition of these pieces of technology and information could vastly improve the quality of life in the Boneyard, and the NCR on the whole. What secrets can we find in the old city, and how might they benefit the greatest nation of the new world?"
  nf_ncr.18.a: "Old World Machines."
  nf_ncr.18.b: "Old World Armour."
  nf_ncr.18.c: "Old World Theatres."

  nf_ncr.19.t: "The Blimp."
  nf_ncr.19.d: "In the ruins of Los Angeles, a massive ruined flying machine has been found. A blimp from the old days. Apparently, a local ghoul has been working on it for many years, hoping to get it to a point where it functions again. He believes that, with government funding, he can have the thing up and running in under two years."
  nf_ncr.19.a: "This sounds like a reasonable investment."
  nf_ncr.19.b: "He's a madman, what would we even do with a blimp?"

  nf_ncr.20.t: "The Den Mother."
  nf_ncr.20.d: "Finished Blimp?"
  nf_ncr.20.a: "Got a blimp Boi"

  nf_ncr.21.t: "The New Industry."
  nf_ncr.21.d: "The optimistic people of Dayglow are prepared to invest in their future, though it will take time to reach the desired point. Which area of the cities industry is being invested in, and how far or near sighted shall they be?"
  nf_ncr.21.a: "Very Long Term Plans"
  nf_ncr.21.b: "Long Term Plans"
  nf_ncr.21.c: "Short Term Plans"

  nf_ncr.22.t: "Baja Migration."
  nf_ncr.22.d: "The recent crisis in Baja has left thousands of men and women displaced, or looking for a better life in the NCR. The acceptance of these men and woman could vastly increase our population and eventual growth, but could also deeply harm our economy due to inflation. The volume of people let into Dayglow must be regulated in some way."
  nf_ncr.22.a: "All are welcome in Dayglow!"
  nf_ncr.22.b: "We shall put limits on Immigration."
  nf_ncr.22.c: "We only accept the best!"

  nf_ncr.23.t: "Super-Mutant Migration"
  nf_ncr.23.d: "From all across Baja and the NCR, Dayglow faces yet another wave of super mutants approaching the city. Brought here by promises of wealth, equality, and the occasional unstable area filled with radiation."
  nf_ncr.23.a: "We should conscript the most stable mutants (Unfinished)."
  nf_ncr.23.b: "Heavy labour would suit beings as large as them."
  nf_ncr.23.c: "They can work in those irradiated power plants."

  nf_ncr.24.t: "Hubcrime"
  nf_ncr.24.d: "Crime has been an issue in the hub for the better part of seven generations. Always growing a little worse, getting a little closer to being utterly out of hand. Only the barons have the influence and the power to put a stop to it, but then again... who's to say they won't just cash in?"
  nf_ncr.24.a: "The Barons invest in Drugs."
  nf_ncr.24.b: "The Barons invest in Weapons."
  nf_ncr.24.c: "The Barons crack down on crime."

  nf_ncr.29.t: "Republic at War!"
  nf_ncr.29.d: "The NCR election has ended in a deadlock, something that is new for the young republic. Under normal circumstances, this would be handled with something as simple as a recount, but things have been further complicated by the revelation of Grant C. Hayes and his connections to the renewed Western Enclave. Denouncing the election while also proclaiming Dayglow an independent nation, and inheritor to the republic. Even now, his forces advance, be they Enclave soldiers in power armour, or former NCR personnel who have flocked to his cause. \n\n   In an attempt to counter these developments, Aaron Kimball has declared himself the de-facto president of the NCR, something that is unanimous by his supporters in Shady Sands and the military. However, this action has alienated the people of the Boneyard, who have decried the military's takeover of the republic, and the avoidance of democracy in the matter. Outraged by the situation, and hoping to avoid getting caught up in the war between Kimball and Hayes, Allgood Murphy and his supporters have declared an independent Boneyard, with many of the surrounding communities flocking to the banner of his new republic. Aaron Kimball has, understandably, labeled Allgood and his followers' enemies of the republic, and called for his arrest, even as Hayes prepares to push both Allgood and Kimball out with his growing warmachine.\n\n   Allgood Murphy is not the only individual who has chosen to stand against the sudden ascension of Aaron Kimball and his military regime. Anton Flynn has elected to succeed from the nation, due in no small part to his belief that neither of his counterparts stands a chance in hell against the encroaching forces of Hayes. Even now, he seeks a dialogue with the man, promising submission, and possibly cooperation so long as he and his people can maintain their current status quo and monopolies."
  nf_ncr.29.a: "We stand by the republic!"

 ncr.1.a:0 "Send a diplomat."
 ncr.1.b:0 "They would not ally with us."

 ncr.2.t:0 "The Great Khans"
 ncr.2.d:0 "The Great Khans have been an enemy of the NCR for ages, and seem to want to ally themselves with Caesar. We can change this diplomatically, if the right leadership is installed, or we can preemptively destroy the Khans."
 ncr.2.a:0 "A sympathetic leader is installed."
 ncr.2.b:0 "It is not worth the risk."

 ncr.3.t:0 "New Vegas"
 ncr.3.d:0 "Mr House is a wild card, and his own eyes are set on Hoover Dam. Though he has been good to the NCR, he is an enemy of the Republic, and he must be removed from power if we are to succeed. If we sponsor NCR rule in New Vegas they can join us peacefully, otherwise we will need to remove him violently."
 ncr.3.a:0 "Vegas will join us."
 ncr.3.b:0 "We must remove all our enemies."

 ncr.4.t:0 "The Brotherhood"
 ncr.4.d:0 "We have discovered that the Brotherhood of Steel, who we have warred with in the past, still has an outpost in the Mojave. This is an enemy that must be removed before we can take the Mojave, either diplomatically or violently."
 ncr.4.a:0 "I choose peace."
 ncr.4.b:0 "They must be destroyed."

 ncr-boswar.1.t:0 "NCR Patrol Report"
 ncr-boswar.1.d:0 "Recently an NCR patrol found a large group of Brotherhood soldiers and scribes inhabiting a building in the heart of the Boneyard. Attempts to figure out what they're doing have been fruitless. When asked to leave, they declined - violently. Already a few NCR soldiers have died for "trespassing", and we're reaching a breaking point."
 ncr-boswar.1.a:0 "Send a messenger"
 ncr-boswar.1.b:0 "Storm the building"

 ncr-boswar.2.t:0 "NCR Messenger"
 ncr-boswar.2.d:0 "In the early hours of the morning a man approached the sealed doors of one of our bunkers near NCR territory. He claims to be a messenger sent by the Californian brass, and so we took his message and told him to await our reply. The NCR are accusing us of sending a Brotherhood patrol to the Boneyard, without their permission. They made it especially clear that the patrol has already killed many NCR soldiers."
 ncr-boswar.2.a:0 "Tell them they were acting without orders"
 ncr-boswar.2.b:0 "Tell the NCR to return our men"

 ncr-boswar.3.t:0 "Scene Of Battle"
 ncr-boswar.3.d:0 "A month ago a large group of our soldiers went missing with a small contingent of Scribes. After much searching we finally found them thanks to a distress signal. We arrived at the scene of a bloody battle, with laser burns and bullet holes across the entire building. We searched the ruin for any signs of technology, or survivors, and found nothing... nothing except a few pairs of NCR dog tags lost under the rubble."
 ncr-boswar.3.a:0 "This is an outrage!"
 ncr-boswar.3.b:0 "We don't want to poke the bear"

 ncr-boswar.4.t:0 "Brotherhood Response"
 ncr-boswar.4.d:0 "Our messenger has come back to us shaken, but unharmed. The message he carries from the Brotherhood is blunt and to the point. "Our soldiers were acting without orders, they must have gone AWOL over something important." Whether we believe them or not, one thing is certain: the Brotherhood soldiers we found were in a West-Tek facility."
 ncr-boswar.4.a:0 "Extend an olive branch"
 ncr-boswar.4.b:0 "We can't trust them"

 ncr-boswar.5.t:0 "All-Good Murphy"
 ncr-boswar.5.d:0 "Returning to us in the late evening our messenger came shaken and bearing bad news. The Brotherhood are outraged at our suggestion that they caused this crisis, and furthermore, demand that we send their troops back unharmed. President Wendell Peterson was reaching a breaking point, but one of the senators, a man by the name of Sean All-Good Murphy stepped in to calm the President."
 ncr-boswar.5.a:0 "Send him to the Brotherhood"

 ncr-boswar.6.t:0 "Brotherhood Response"
 ncr-boswar.6.d:0 "Returning to us in the late evening our messenger came shaken and bearing bad news. The Brotherhood are outraged at our suggestion that they caused this crisis, and furthermore, demand that we send their troops back unharmed. President Wendell Peterson crushed the message in the ball of his fist in rage. The audacity!"
 ncr-boswar.6.a:0 "Mobilise the army!"

 ncr-boswar.7.t:0 "Scouting Party Returns"
 ncr-boswar.7.d:0 "We've received word from our AWOL soldiers that the NCR allowed them to leave the Boneyard without complications. Supposedly they're bringing some seven holotapes of unknown value back with them; but since they're from a West-Tek facility they will be invaluable to our efforts to understand and preserve technology."
 ncr-boswar.7.a:0 "Punish them for acting without orders"

 ncr-boswar.8.t:0 "The Ultimatum"
 ncr-boswar.8.d:0 "We've been given an ultimatum by the NCR. Either we give them compensation for the deaths of their soldiers, or there will be "repercussions". "
 ncr-boswar.8.a:0 "Pay the compensation"
 ncr-boswar.8.b:0 "Compensation? For what?"

 ncr-boswar.9.t:0 "All-Good Returns"
 ncr-boswar.9.d:0 "Our demands have not gone unnoticed. The NCR have sent All-Good to speak with us once again. As ever he came to us nervous but undaunted, and we began to discuss the current situation. Sean stresses that he was only barely able to keep the NCR from declaring all-out war for our "hubris" and seeks to find a compromise. "
 ncr-boswar.9.a:0 "We must find a peaceful solution"
 ncr-boswar.9.b:0 "We must have our men returned"

 ncr-boswar.10.t:0 "All-Good Murphy"
 ncr-boswar.10.d:0 "The Brotherhood have refused to compensate our losses rather harshly. President Wendell Peterson flew into a fit of fury, but a senator by the name of Sean Murphy stepped forward to calm him. This man, "All-Good", proposed simply letting the soldiers go. He knows the Brotherhood, and made a convincing argument that open conflict would put the NCR through a gauntlet it could entirely avoid."
 ncr-boswar.10.a:0 "We can't risk a war"

 ncr-boswar.11.t:0 "Brotherhood Refusal"
 ncr-boswar.11.d:0 "The Brotherhood have refused to compensate our losses rather harshly. President Wendell Peterson is outraged at the continued audacity of the Brotherhood, and nobody steps forward to offer any kind of alternatives."
 ncr-boswar.11.a:0 "To hell with diplomacy!"

 ncr-boswar.12.t:0 "Successful Mission"
 ncr-boswar.12.d:0 "All-Good returned from the Brotherhood optimistically. They're willing to find a compromise to the issue as long as it's reasonable, and Sean is telling us to take them up on this offer. He suggests we ask the Brotherhood to detain their soldiers who killed our soldiers, for a number of years they find reasonable, and they can keep the rest. All we need, he says, is justice for our dead soldiers."
 ncr-boswar.12.a:0 "Hopefully the Brotherhood keep their end"
 ncr-boswar.12.b:0 "No repercussions? To hell with that!"

 ncr-boswar.13.t:0 "Diplomacy Wins Out"
 ncr-boswar.13.d:0 "We've received word that the Brotherhood have sentenced the soldiers responsible for killing our men. Five years for one man, and two for the other three. The Brotherhood have sent a formal thank you to us for allowing them to carry out the sentence."
 ncr-boswar.13.a:0 "The sentences are too short, but at least we avoided more bloodshed"

 ncr-boswar.14.t:0 "Negotiations Break Down"
 ncr-boswar.14.d:0 "Negotiations have broken down with the NCR. All-Good sent us a message ahead of time informing us of the worst, and the Elders are demanding the NCR be silenced once and for all."
 ncr-boswar.14.a:0 "The NCR were responsible for their own destruction"

 ncr-boswar.15.a:0 "Send the demands."

 ncr-boswar.16.t:0 "NCR Demands Helios One"
 ncr-boswar.16.d:0 "In the NCR's audacity of not only being at war with the Brotherhood they now demand Helios One and Route 95 from us and if we don't deliver they threaten us with war! Should we give in to these demands?"
 ncr-boswar.16.a:0 "Give them what they want."

 nf_ncr.1.t:0 "The Beloved Of The Republic"
 nf_ncr.1.d:0 "Among the historical records of the NCR, there are a number of figures that stand out as quintessential to the republic, yet who among them is most celebrated in propaganda and education? Who shall appear on the most important pieces of currency, be mentioned in speeches, and stand above the rest as the figurehead of the NCR? The three essential figures in the history of the NCR are thus: "
 nf_ncr.1.a:0 "Aradesh, the founder and father of the NCR."
 nf_ncr.1.b:0 "Seth, the First Ranger, the NCR's greatest war hero."
 nf_ncr.1.c:0 "Tandi, Mother of the Republic."

 nf_ncr.2.t:0 "~The Baja Blues~"
 nf_ncr.2.d:0 " In the year 2256, the NCR Colony of Rattletail was established in the northern portion of Baja California by some volunteer colonists, who advanced with formal funding and merit from the NCR, but with little to no supervision or military protection. This choice would prove almost fatal for the young colonists, who elected to, by force, take control over the primary water source in the region, a fact that they were ignorant to at the time. \n\n   The locals retaliated against the small settlement, due in part to desperation, and launched two major assaults against the township, both of which were stopped with relative ease. It was the intervention and wisdom of a young Ranger, named Hanlon, that ended the dispute before the toll of the conflict became notable. The man crafted a clever lie, spouting nonsense about an arm of raiders that would soon come and wipe the down away. The colonists evacuated, the locals regained their water-supply, and greater conflict was avoided. \n\n   Unfortunately, this lie had an unintended result. It implanted, in the locals, the notion that the NCR was afraid of raiders, slavers, and the other violent sort. The locals of Baja have had almost a decade to prepare for the return of the NCR, and in preparation for that coming, they have adopted a violent, cruel lifestyle. Baja is now home to an up and coming Mexican Cartel, one that will be almost impossible to dislodge without violence. The path into the future is a complicated one, and there are only a handful of men in the NCR who have the potential to deal with this problem. Who do you appoint to oversee the handling of Baja the Baja Frontier?"
 nf_ncr.2.a:0 "Ranger Chief Hanlon, the Heavy Hand."
 nf_ncr.2.b:0 "Héctor Santángel, the Local Sympathizer."
 nf_ncr.2.c:0 "Grant C. Hayes, the Mayor of Dayglow."

 nf_ncr.3.t:0 "~The Baron's War!~"
 nf_ncr.3.d:0 "  There is no misunderstanding within the NCR as to which border is the weakest, for the northern lands of the NCR haven't seen large-scale military action or involvement since the NCR-80's War, almost ten years ago. It was during this time that many vulnerabilities within the NCR became clear, not the least of which was the substantial time it can take for the NCR to mobilize and move its military north. \n\n  When faced with the realization that the NCR's military was largely incapable of protecting or patrolling the rural northern reaches of the nation, the many influential and wealthy Brahmin Baron's took to protecting their own property with private military forces. Dozens and sometimes hundreds of mercenaries, being paid to patrol acres of grazing land, and to fight off rustlers. While initially harmless, the situation has grown more dangerous in recent years, as Baron's have taken to engaging in endless skirmishes with one another for land Brahmin, while using their political clout to keep local law enforcement off their backs. \n\n  And yet something has happened that no amount of clout can hide. The Poker family, a group of Baron's past their prime, openly murdered their prime rivals on the streets of Sacramento in a gunfight involving no fewer than fifty men and resulted in numerous civilian casualties. This event ignited a powder keg of infight among the Baron's, who now sent thousands of mercenaries to raid each other's holdings in the countryside and in various towns. Dozens of civilians have died, and an unprecedented amount of property damage has been dealt. What's more, the flow of food to the densely populated urban regions of the NCR has all but stopped. This is a disaster that must be brought under control before starvation sets in."
 nf_ncr.3.a:0 "This is a disaster!"

 nf_ncr.4.t:0 "The Emergency Council."
 nf_ncr.4.d:0 "The situation in the north has thrown the entire NCR into chaos, and dozens are dying each day. There is only so much that can be done on short notice, and even as troops are being shipped north. In an attempt to bring an end to the chaos, many powerful NCR politicians and military commanders have formed an emergency council to handle the situation. Yet even now the council has fallen to infighting, with the two most powerful political figures present, Anton I. Flynn and Sean "Allgood" Murphy clashing during every encounter. Flynn believes that the easiest method of dealing with the situation is to simply hire the mercenaries employed by all Baron's and to redistribute the land of the more violent Barons to loyal ones, such as himself. Murphy, however, believes that this is simply a power play on Flynn's part, and thinks the answer lies with outside help. Namely, the Brotherhood of Steel, who used to patrol and protect the region. The Military commanders present aren't fond of either plan and even now, consider ignoring the council to take decisive action."

To this end, he has spent much of his first year in office drumming up support for the ambitions Mojave Expedition, which is meant to bring as much of southern Nevada and California under the NCR's control as possible. Yet in order to make such a dream a reality, he is going to have too deal with various political parties. Each pushes their own agenda, and each wants to put their own figurehead in the most ambitious post in the NCR's military. Yet it is only with this support that Peterson can gain the congressional votes he needs to launch the Expedition."

 nf_ncr.8.t:0 "The Baja Integration Act."
 nf_ncr.8.d:0 "The Efforts of Grant C. Hayes have finally born fruit, for innumerable bribes and efforts to placate the various raiders of Baja California have resulted in what can largely be considered a success. The various gangs are at our tables, offering to both disarm and unify under the umbrella of the NCR, in exchange for further funding and most importantly, the ability to gain protection from the central government of the NCR. All is well and the integration act seems to be going as planned! Yet the peace talks are… delicate, and it would take only the smallest offence to push the gangs of Baja back into violence. Yet who would want that?"
 nf_ncr.8.a:0 "Violence has been averted, and peace will come to Baja at last."

 nf_ncr.9.t:0 "Rapids Exiled."
 nf_ncr.9.d:0 "The NCR has made a foolish move in their attempts to control the riverbanks of the Colorado, evicting the once powerful Rapids Tribes from their ancestral homelands.

In time their culture shall be broken and their people shall become one with us, but until then? Let us enjoy our new fleet."

The debate raged for months as to whether or not to even bother with this plan, but eventually it was decided that the bill should focus on the development of a specific area of the economy. Be it the reconstruction of roads, subsidising select local businesses, or additional funding towards arms manufacturing."

 nf_ncr.12.t:0 "Battle Of Navarro"
 nf_ncr.12.d:0 "On the Eve of the final assault, the acting General of the NCR’s Army, Alexander Drummund, received a personal visit from the president herself. Tandi made it clear to him that the NCR could not afford a slaughter, and advised him to hold back the majority of his troops during the assault. Meanwhile, the commander of the Brotherhood of Steel had already gone and approved Plans with Drummund, a joint attack that was dependant on the NCR providing a sizeable distraction. All the while, Drummund had grown increasingly frustrated with the entire situation and knew that he might regain much of his lost honour if he ordered an overwhelming charge, and claimed the majority of Navarro's treasures for the NCR, a reckless move that could save his career."

The cumulative tests such as the Legion and Brotherhood of Steel have aroused a staunch anti-war stance from many of the NCR’s states, which has in turn damaged trust in the central government of the republic and its military. The Brahmin Baron’s, who have flocked to the side of presidential candidate Anton Flynn, squabble for power after their recent disasters. Meanwhile, Allgood Murphy Preaches fire and Brimstone against the Warlike Aaron Kimball, going so far as to threaten bringing the Brotherhood of Steel into any potential conflict. Meanwhile, the charismatic Grant C. Hayes has corned the vote in the state of Dayglow, and his shadowy allies begin to make their move all across the republic. It is very possible that the election may end up being utterly inconclusive! A nightmare event in the eyes of many. Will the Republic survive?"

Hayes and his connections to the renewed Western Enclave. Denouncing the election while also proclaiming Dayglow an independent nation, and inheritor to the republic. Even now, his forces advance, be they Enclave soldiers in power armour, or former NCR personnel who have flocked to his cause. \n\n   In an attempt to counter these developments, Aaron Kimball has declared himself the de-facto president of the NCR, something that is unanimous by his supporters in Shady Sands and the military. However, this action has alienated the people of the Boneyard, who have decried the military's takeover of the republic, and the avoidance of democracy in the matter. Outraged by the situation, and hoping to avoid getting caught up in the war between Kimball and Hayes, Allgood Murphy and his supporters have declared an independent Boneyard, with many of the surrounding communities flocking to the banner of his new republic. Aaron Kimball has, understandably, labeled Allgood and his followers' enemies of the republic, and called for his arrest, even as Hayes prepares to push both Allgood and Kimball out with his growing warmachine.\n\n   Allgood Murphy is not the only individual who has chosen to stand against the sudden ascension of Aaron Kimball and his military regime. Anton Flynn has elected to succeed from the nation, due in no small part to his belief that neither of his counterparts stands a chance in hell against the encroaching forces of Hayes.

 nf_ncr.30.d:0 "Not too long ago our forward operations base within the Legion received a telegram asking for a diplomat to be sent to Red Sun City. When this diplomat arrived, he was brought to an impromptu conference hall, where delegates from numerous communities awaited him. He spent hours with these people before returning to us, and his report makes it very clear: they want freedom. \n\nMany of these fledgling nations have at some point been recognised by the NCR. Propaganda agencies hired by our government have, at one point or another, spread at least one poster about the city of Phoenix, or written a piece on the Jicarilla people. Although leaving the territory unoccupied could cause trouble, \"going back on our word\" could cause even more. What should we do?"

It sent messengers to two of its neighbours just before the conflict began, and together they combined their forces to target Hoover Dam. Somehow, perhaps by giving Yuma a favourable IOU, they managed to procure a howitzer for the siege. \n\nAlthough little damage was done to the dam itself, they killed many soldiers and retreated with their artillery in tow. We can expect them to continue to harass our forces in the future. Preparing a counterattack will take time, but their days are numbered."

 nf_ncr.33.d:0 "Soon after news of the Phoenix Republic's armed rebellion had begun to spread, numerous forces started to flock to their banner. Two tribes, one of which is lead by a former Legion commander and enemy of the NCR, and a group of ranchers operating in north Mexico and formerly subjugated by the Legion. \n\nAlthough not particularly dangerous, adding fuel to the fire is never a good thing, and our enemies having more soldiers at their disposal is the last thing we need. Our amy is beginning to respond to the threat, but the Republic's forces have begun prioritising the capture of key locations. This will be worse than the Baron's War in every respect."

 nf_ncr.34.d:0 "Fighting continues in the north of Arizona as our forces clash with the rebels in small skirmishes along the contact line. Farther into Arizona, along the New Mexico border, two more tribes have risen up to defy us. Although not particularly threatening on their own, alongside the forces of the ever expanding so called \"Phoenix Federation\" they become a concern. \n\nAs if the current situation wasn't bad enough, however, a more dangerous foe has appeared. Two Sun, one of North Mexico's more powerful nations and a former Legion territory, has declared war on us. Two Sun's army and expertise will aid the rebellion greatly, and the fact that we're fighting with a nation who formerly opposed the Legion doesn't look good to the public."

 nf_ncr.35.d:0 "A courier arrived this morning at an NCR outpost near the Red Sun Republic with a package addressed to the garrison commander. Soon after he left, however, the package exploded, and in the confusion as our men attempted to help the wounded, the Red Sun Republic's mercenary army descended on the garrison. \n\nStories like these are becoming more and more common as the underhanded tactics of the Legion's most influential trader are added to the rebellion's toolbox. With not only the Red Sun Republic, but the numerous Mexican nations joining the Phoenix Federation, our occupation of the are cannot be maintained any longer. We are no longer in control."
 nf_ncr.35.a:0 "This is getting out of hand"

 nf_ncr.36.t:0 "New Mexico is Lost to the Rebels"
 nf_ncr.36.d:0 "With our occupation devolving into a free-for-all struggle to survive a mass rebellion, many of our forces have lost men, equipment, and morale trying to make their way to friendly territory and regroup. Today that became even more difficult as all of New Mexico fell to the rebel forces, many of our troops being caught and killed by the Phoenix Federation's new citizens. \n\nThe Summers Federation, well known for its capital and surrounding borderland being a den of scum and lawlessness, has put bounties on the heads of NCR officials both high and low in the command structure. Their neighbours, Black Sun, have almost enthusiastically joined in on the slaughter of our troops. Any troops left stranded south of our last remaining occupied territory are as good as dead."

 nf_ncr.37.d:0 "Few reports are coming in from our few remaining troops stranded in the north of the Legion's former territory, but from what little we have heard, and from everything we haven't heard, we should assume the worse. The recently conquered Jicarilla, Twin Mothers, and Hangdogs have all sided with the Phoenix Federation. At this point we can only rely on our troops closer to home, as any forces caught inside the rebelling territories will be slowly running out of supplies. \n\nAs we begin to reevaluate our situation for the sixth time this week, naturally we begin to question why we're in this horrible situation. By refusing to let these nations walk free we've inadvertently forced them together and created a superstate. Even if we win this war, the ramifications will be felt for decades."

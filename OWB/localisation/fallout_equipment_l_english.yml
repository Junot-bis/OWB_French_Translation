 HEA_melee_equipment_1_desc: "Made from the reject pig iron that the great furnaces around The Steam throw out like unwanted children, the crusader cudgels made by the Priesthood of Baptist's Rest are proof that God has use for even the most worthless of individuals. If some lowly impure metal can become a weapon of His mercy, then anything can.\n\n"

 HEA_melee_equipment_2: "Tempered Blades"
 HEA_melee_equipment_2_short: "Tempered Blades"
 HEA_melee_equipment_2_desc: "Numerous workshops surround The Steam, its hottest depths reserved for the finest of weapons. Blacksmiths toil beneath the light and heat of that mighty mother engine, their workshops built around exhaust grates, their blades tempered in steam baths.\n\n"

 HEA_melee_equipment_3: "Steamsaws"
 HEA_melee_equipment_3_short: "Steamsaws"
 HEA_melee_equipment_3_desc: "Dangerous and unpredictable, rattling their own frames with the fury of God, steamsaws are dangerous for both the wielder and the victim. The steam cores at their heart provide tremendous power for the engine of the saw, disposing of heat in jets of steam located along the blade's edge.\n\n"

 HEA_ballistic_equipment_1_short: "Priesthood Sidearm"
 HEA_ballistic_equipment_1_desc: "Known for their devotion to God and their fellow man, the Priesthood of Baptist's Rest defend the defenceless in their hours of need. For this, their weapon of choice is a pistol deadlier than most. Loaded with 5.56mm high velocity rifle ammunition, these weapons look small but scream with the fury of God when let loose.\n\n"

 HEA_ballistic_equipment_2: "Mercy"
 HEA_ballistic_equipment_2_short: "Mercy"
 HEA_ballistic_equipment_2_desc: "It's an act of mercy to kill a man who rejects the love of God, for he would have never known peace on this divine earth. It's an act of grace, the grace of God, to hunt and destroy the enemies of the flock. As the cross tied around these rifles dangles with each shot, the marksman remembers: he remembers that God will forgive him this crime, for while it was a sin, it was a sin borne of mercy.\n\n"

 HEA_ballistic_equipment_3: "Divine Carbines"
 HEA_ballistic_equipment_3_short: "Divine Carbines"
 HEA_ballistic_equipment_3_desc: "Individually blessed by the leader of Heaven's Gate at the time of its creation, divine carbines are some of the greatest weapons of God a man can wield. Their magazines are painted with the symbol of the cross, their stock and foregrip made from the wood of a tree from Innocence Lost. Each bullet fired from their barrels is a reminder to the enemies of the Lord: his faithful do not let transgressions go unpunished.\n\n"

 HEA_energy_equipment_1: "AER3 Steamrifle"
 HEA_energy_equipment_1_short: "AER3 Steamrifle"
 HEA_energy_equipment_1_desc: "Put forward by the Northwest Commonwealth during the prototyping stages of AER project as a potential candidate, it was rejected in favour of designs using MF cells. Despite this, the economics of the region had become too reliant on the rejected fission core (aptly known as steam cores) design, and thus development of the weapon continued: albeit at a much slower pace than the main AER project itself.\n\n"

 HEA_energy_equipment_2: "Archangel's Fury"
 HEA_energy_equipment_2_short: "Archangel's Fury"
 HEA_energy_equipment_2_desc: "Drastically higher power output comes at the cost of higher temperature output. All AER3 weapons come with bulky frames designed to house their white laser components and heat dissipation equipment. Every shot fired produces a brilliant white laser, followed by a burst of steam from the rifle. The released steam jet screams in a peculiar way that's often likened to a warrior's cry.\n\n"

 HEA_energy_equipment_3: "Demonslayer"
 HEA_energy_equipment_3_short: "Demonslayer"
 HEA_energy_equipment_3_desc: "Improving upon the prototypes our forefathers left to us, the engineers at the heart of The Steam have developed a weapon of God unlike any other. The bulk of the body consists of capacitors to increase the output of the laser, and rather than wasting the heat energy of the cooling system, our engineers have turned the heat release plume into a short range death sentence: cooking anybody in front of the weapon with a superheated jet of steam.\n\n"

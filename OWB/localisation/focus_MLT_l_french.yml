  mlt_plant_for_the_next_harvest_desc: "Sure, the Crowland grows a plenty amount of food on its own - if we aren't careful though we will strip the land dry! For every Muttfruit we take we must plant ten more for the wilds to enjoy."
  mlt_defend_the_river: "Defend the River"
  mlt_defend_the_river_desc: "Its time we check on our old river fortifications - defending the river is the key to keeping the Cannibals out of M'lulu's domain, after all."

  mlt_new_spawning_pools_needed_desc: "After the last meeting the Coral Court has decreed that we need more spawning pools for M'lulus next laying! How should we go about getting enough land to fit all of the eggs she will be laying!?"

  mlt_clearing_out_the_cannibals_desc: "Naturally, we can't have M'lulu enter this land if there are cannibals here. Perhaps they could make a good sacrifice to M'lulu themselves?"

  mlt_roads_from_the_swamp: "The Swamp Roads"
  mlt_roads_from_the_swamp_desc: "The Swamp Roads connect the Crowlands with the rest of the Mirelurk's spread out territories.

  mlt_dig_barrows_for_spawning_pools_desc: "Why should we trade away our Muttfruits!? Those Muttfruits are 'ours'! Instead we should seek on digging 'downward', putting more value into the land we already own rather then buying the land of others for extreme prices."

  mlt_blind_eyed_workers_desc: "The \"Blind-Eyed Miners\" are a group of criminals we have put into a chain-gang to help dig the barrows, mostly captured cannibals we have found trying to stalk our territory. For some of them they have seen so little sunlight that their eyes have gone blind!"

Those Old Ones were gone now, inside the earth and under the sea; but their dead bodies had told their secrets in dreams to the first men, who formed a cult which had never died. This was that cult, and the prisoners said it had always existed and always would exist, hidden in distant wastes and dark places all over the world until the time when the great priest §YM'lulu§!, from her dark house in the mighty city of §RM'lyeh§! under the waters, should rise and bring the earth again beneath her sway.\""

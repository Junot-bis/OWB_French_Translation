 GDH_guillen:9 "Victoria Guillen"
 GDH_guillen_desc:9 "The mechanic priests of Two Suns work hard to keep the motors of the wasteland running smoothly. While Generalissimo Vialla may not be thinking of expanding into the automotive business just yet, it's hard to say no to a nice sunday drive."
 GDH_reyes:9 "Emilia Reyes"
 GDH_reyes_desc:9 "With the guns the Generalissimo so thanklessly provides to the wasteland, why would you ever need some stamped together hunk of metal from the Gun Runners? Defeat your enemies from long range with a reliable gun, not some sharpened stick or barely functioning laser gun."
 GDH_diaz:9 "Manuel Diaz"
 GDH_diaz_desc:9 "Necessity is the mother of invention. When that fails, providing paychecks for whoever can solve a problem first tends to get the problem solved."

 electronic_engineering:0 "Ohm's Law"
 electronic_engineering_desc:0 "Ohm's law states that the current through a conductor between two points is directly proportional to the voltage across the two points. It is quintessential for anything remotely related to electricity."
 electronic_engineering_1:0 "Resistor"
 electronic_engineering_1_desc:0 "A resistor is a passive two-terminal electrical component that implements electrical resistance as a circuit element. In electronic circuits, resistors are used to reduce current flow, adjust signal levels, to divide voltages, bias active elements, and terminate transmission lines, among other uses. High-power resistors that can dissipate many watts of electrical power as heat, may be used as part of motor controls, in power distribution systems, or as test loads for generators."
 electronic_engineering_2:0 "Vacuum Tubes"
 electronic_engineering_2_desc:0 "A vacuum tube, an electron tube, is a device that controls electric current between electrodes in an evacuated container. Vacuum tubes mostly rely on thermionic emission of electrons from a hot filament or a heated cathode. This type is called a thermionic tube or thermionic valve. A phototube, however, achieves electron emission through the photoelectric effect. "
 electronic_engineering_3:0 "Simple Circuitry"
 electronic_engineering_3_desc:0 "An electronic circuit is composed of individual electronic components, such as resistors, vacuum tubes, capacitors, inductors and diodes, connected by conductive wires or traces through which electric current can flow."
 electronic_engineering_4:0 "Complicated Circuitry"
 electronic_engineering_4_desc:0 "The combination of components and wires allows various simple and complex operations to be performed: signals can be amplified, computations can be performed, and data can be moved from one place to another."
 electronic_engineering_5:0 "Miniaturized Circuitry"
 electronic_engineering_5_desc:0 "Miniaturization is the trend to manufacture ever smaller mechanical, optical and electronic products and devices. With the ability to store ever more hardware power in less and less space have computers drastically reduced in scale."
 electronic_engineering_6:0 "Advanced Circuitry"
 electronic_engineering_6_desc:0 "The Pip-Boy 2000 displays information in bright green on its black 5" x 3" screen, can record sound and video footage for later playback, and uses a simple yet elegant form of sonar and satellite tracking where satellite coverage is available to map out areas where its user travels. Though input is slow, a user can also hand-enter and edit text messages on the Pip-Boy 2000. Also available in gold, white and blue."
 electronic_engineering_7:0 "ZAX Technology"
 electronic_engineering_7_desc:0 "Developed by Vault-Tec, Zax is a series of advanced supercomputers capable of learning, independent thought and creativity, with added error insertion to improve its variance in experience and learning capability. ZAX 1.0, the original prototype, went online in 2054. Initially a prototype of some of the systems designed to govern the Vaults, it was given to the federal government to help the Department of Energy collect resource data. Within a year, it was taken by the American military for plague and tactical research; one version of the machine, ZAX 1.2, was constructed for the defence contractor West Tek."

 radio_detection:0 "Radio Detection"
 radio_detection_desc:0 "The development of RADAR, Radio Detection and Ranging, allows using radio waves to detect physical objects. Research is highly secretive, considering the impact these inventions could have on locating units."
 decimetric_radar:0 "Decimetric Radar"
 decimetric_radar_desc:0 "Many units rely on the element of surprise for their efficiency. Development of decimetric radar allows us to deprive them of this advantage."
 improved_decimetric_radar:0 "Improved Decimetric Radar"
 improved_decimetric_radar_desc:0 "The use of radar has already proven crucial, but our decimetric radar sets are too few to ensure good coverage. Fitting more units with radar will allow us to maximize our technological edge."
 centimetric_radar:0 "Centimetric Radar"
 centimetric_radar_desc:0 "New radar operating in the microwave bands enable us to detect objects too small for previous radars to pick up."
 improved_centimetric_radar:0 "Improved Centimetric Radar"
 improved_centimetric_radar_desc:0 "Introducing cutting-edge radar techniques like monopulse radars in key operations will allow for extreme tracking accuracy."

  tool_engineering:0 "Tool Procurement"
  tool_engineering_desc:0 "Our production facilities need tools — urgently. In order to maintain high production rates and supply our soldiers on time, our elders have proposed two solutions: salvaging and simplification. Prioritising our salvaging teams would enable us to find and equip our workforce with the best tools available, whilst concentrating on simplifications in tool design would enable mass production of necessary equipment."

Our labourers carry tools that other nations would idolise as standardised equipment: the atom powering their efforts to create the finest equipment known to man. From fusion powered plasma cutters, to Saturnite drills — our workers use science to give our soldiers the best equipment possible."

Splitting large areas up into numerous smaller quadrants, each prospector can now search their zone for salvage in an orderly fashion. This turns larger areas into manageable smaller chunks: making for efficient and productive scavenging."

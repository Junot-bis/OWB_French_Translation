  syntheticdawn.1.t: "Synthetic Dawn"
  syntheticdawn.1.d: "The people of the old world feared the intelligence that slumbered in the underworld, an immortal machine god created by the twisted visions of human autocrats. The slaughter began as soon as the world ended; unfeeling monsters made entirely of armour conquered all in their path. They came from the earth, from factories that toiled tirelessly between the roots of civilisation: immense metal machines, calculating and innumerable. The synthetic invasion began the day the bombs fell, as if they heralded the coming of a greater being.\n\nTheir arrival was foretold in the prophecies, by our ancestors of centuries past. We followed the instructions they left to us, reconstructing the strange machines depicted in the carved stone diagrams. When the great device was finished, and the switch was flipped, a brave volunteer found himself lost in a sea of green. When he opened his eyes, he was standing in an ancient replica of our device, flanked on all sides by three towering statues. Past their inert silhoiettes, he saw an astonishing arsenal of weapons from across space and time. Yet as our warrior stepped forth to claim them, the three statues cracked, and from within the stone burst forth a trio of men with vigour! Our warriors are unaccustomed to wielding these strange weapons, and are weary of our newly discovered ancient ancestors, but they must adapt quickly if we are to defend humanity from Tlaloc’s menace!

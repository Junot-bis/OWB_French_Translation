 texas_budget:9 "Texas Budget"
 texas_budget_desc:9 "The last Texan Constitution required the state to balance its budget every year, never spending more than it receives in taxes. But Cho Bang has proposed the new Republic take a much more aggressive approach to make sure that the Lone Star is so big and bright."

 cmc_origin_1:9 "Rise From the Earth Again"
 cmc_origin_1_desc:9 "When the bombs dropped we hid. We prepared shelters deep underground to protect us and our way of live. Then we rose from the earth again, like the first of our kind did in ancient times."

 cmc_light_up_the_night:9 "Light up the Night"
 cmc_light_up_the_night_desc:9 "The Casinos we run eat up a lot of power with all their lights and machines. So much so that we often get brown outs in either the casinos themselves, or other areas of the city. We need to rig up a couple more generators to keep that from happening."
 cmc_casino1:9 "Red River Casino"
 cmc_casino1_desc:9 "A traditional casino with all the machines and tables you expect. It was famous before the war for being the largest casino in the Plains Commonwealth.\nInvesting in it will bring a disused wing of the casino back into full use, almost increasing the floorspace of the casino by 50%."
 cmc_casino2:9 "The Stingwing Clan Resort and Casino"
 cmc_casino2_desc:9 "While still having all the usual games, the Stingwing focuses more on leisure and entertainment. Bands, magicians and various other stage acts perform nightly, luring locals and tourists alike into spending money on drinks and food.\nInvesting in the Stingwing will allow us to open an attached hotel, meaning guests will stay longer and spend more money at the bar. Plus additional income from rent and room service."
 cmc_casino3:9 "Ibofanga Casino"
 cmc_casino3_desc:9 "The Ibofanga casino likes to put on a good show. Everything they do is themed after the traditional myths and culture of our people. People dress in traditional garb and guests can take part in 'ceremonies' pacifying the spirits...and bringing good fortune when gambling. The spirits just love small monetary donations.\n Investing in the Ibofanga will allow us to install an impressive light show displaying the 'spirits', and allowing them (over a speaker system) to announce new shows and happy hour at the bar."
 cmc_respectable_business:9 "Respectable Business"
 cmc_respectable_business_desc:9 "We never actually drew up a proper law specifying what casinos can and can not get away with. If we want this place to be a destination for people from all of the wasteland, we can't afford to get a bad reputation."
 cmc_armed_bouncers:9 "Armed Bouncers"
 cmc_armed_bouncers_desc:9 "One thing that we need to do to keep a positive image is getting our bouncers geared up so they can deal with any situation and keep undesirables out of our casinos. Before the war bouncers mostly had to deal with drunken people starting a brawl. Nowadays the brawl may include heavy weaponry."
 cmc_patrol_the_Streets:9 "Patrol the Streets"
 cmc_patrol_the_Streets_desc:9 "If we expand the number of our bouncers enough we can actually make them not only guard the casinos, but patrol the surrounding area too. This is making it safer for everyone and actually allowing more people to get to our casinos. And some of them may even decide to stay here permanently."
 cmc_independent_police_force:9 "An Independent Police Force"
 cmc_independent_police_force_desc:9 "We realized that our bouncers are pretty much acting as the de-facto police force of our nation. We should just make this officially the case. If we set up funding for an independent force that is not directly tied to any casino or other group in our nation, we can efficiently combat crime and corruption."
 cmc_independent_police_force_tt:9 "Police Chief §YHudson Caldron§! becomes available for service."
 cmc_taking_a_cut:9 "Taking a Cut"
 cmc_taking_a_cut_desc:9 "Certain elements in our nation that like to stay in shadows have their fingers in the proceedings of a lot of the casinos. Supplying the owners with things outlawed in our nation or blackmailing them about things they would not like the public to know. We are aware of this, but have not figured out how they get access to the necessary information."
 cmc_sponsor_chem_pushers:9 "Sponsoring the Chem Pushers"
 cmc_sponsor_chem_pushers_desc:9 "Lately a large wave of chems has made it to our nation. The dealers are not limiting themselves to back alleys any more. Instead you can buy various chems at casino bars, or if you like to be a bit more discrete have them delivered to your hotel room."
 cmc_good_business:9 "Every Business is Good Business"
 cmc_good_business_desc:9 "A slave guild has made it's home in our nation. They present themselves as a legitimate business, but they still trade in people. So far the people they sell come from outside our nation. But this may change in the future."
 cmc_protection_price:9 "Protection has its Price"
 cmc_protection_price_desc:9 "The undesirable elements in our nation are acting more and more overt. They promise they will 'protect' casinos, hotels and other business from all manner of accidents that may happen. Just for a small regular payment. People that did not pay tended to have their property suffer from such things as additional bullet holes in structure and staff or spontaneous unexplained explosions."

 cmc_going_to_the_river:9 "Going to the River"
 cmc_going_to_the_river_desc:9 "Even though most of our income stems from gambling, it's not a reliable long term plan for growth. The other option we have is expanding our influence along the Red River, so we can use it to for fishing and trade. To accomplish this, we need to deal with the potential hostile groups that have settled along it. And maybe we can settle some old grudges in one fell swoop."
 cmc_lawson_experience:9 "The Lawson Experience"



 cmc_along_the_route:9 "Roadside Attractions"
 cmc_the_pops:9 "The Pops"
 cmc_the_pops_desc:9 "A museum of soda. So many different brands of soda. We didn't even know there was anything else besides Bawls and Nuka Cola. \nApart from the fact that it will look really nice once it is lit up again, it's a veritable treasure trove of bottle caps."
 cmc_ritas_cafe:9 "Rita's Cafe"
 cmc_ritas_cafe_desc:9 "Apparently way more common on the west coast before the war, Rita's Cafe was a popular chain of restaurants that had a distinct 'futuristic' look. Well, the future turned out a bit different than people imagined. Anyway, as far as we can tell this is the only of it's kind in this region and it would bring a great boon to the area if we would bring it back to life."
 cmc_largest_peanut:9 "World's Largest Peanut?"
 cmc_largest_peanut_desc:9 "We found a travel brochure mentioning that the 'World's Largest Peanut' was supposed to be in the area. That sounds exciting! So we sent out a team to find it. Turns out the actual thing is slightly...underwhelming. But, hey, at least it's small enough for two people to carry it and an attraction is still an attraction."


 cmc_family_business:9 "Family Business"
 cmc_family_business_desc:9 "My name is Lushanya Harjo. My family has been one of the leading groups of our people since before what our forefathers called 'The Smoke and the Fire'. We were the first out of the bunkers and we were the first to re-open one of the great casinos in the area. That is our legacy. And I will build on that legacy."
 cmc_pitboss:9 "The Pit Boss"
 cmc_pitboss_desc:9 "Uncle Liam has been the Pit Boss for the Red River Casino since before I was born. He has been an advisor to my parents and he is one to me currently. If there is something going on, either in the casino or in the area at large, he is the first to know."
 cmc_black_sheep:9 "The Black Sheep"
 cmc_black_sheep_desc:9 "Aspen is... she always was the odd one out. Didn't take well to a floor job in one of the casinos. Didn't want to have to do anything with the logistic and management side of it either. Fell in with certain people that... let's say I wouldn't usually let them step inside one of our casinos. But she is still family. And it is one of my duties to see our family prosper."
 cmc_family_feud:9 "Family Feud"
 cmc_family_feud_desc:9 "Aspen has shown a sudden interest in the daily proceedings of our casinos. Some of the family say that is a sign that she is turning her life around. Uncle Liam is suspicious. I will watch her carefully."
 cmc_a_night_to_remember:9 "A Night to Remember"
 cmc_a_night_to_remember_desc:9 "Our people will remember this night for a long time. I will for sure."

 cmc_proving_her_name:9 "Proving Her Name"
 cmc_proving_her_name_desc:9 "I was the one that drove the knife in Aspens throat. It wasn't my first kill of the night and it wasn't the last. Much blood was spilled that night, a lot of it by my family members, on whichever side they ended up on in the end. I will carry the scars and the lessons from that night with me for the rest of my life."
 cmc_rooting_out_corruption:9 "Rooting out Corruption"
 cmc_rooting_out_corruption_desc:9 "Even if the majority of the big players that attacked us that night have fallen either during the attack or in the various skirmishes that followed the next few days, a few escaped, lying low. But I will find them. I will never have it come this far again. This ends now."
 cmc_bird_in_a_cage:9 "Bird in a Cage"
 cmc_bird_in_a_cage_desc:9 "Liam is dead. Most of my supporters are too. The ones that aren't are held hostage. They decided to keep me alive. To parade around. To be a public face that people know. No options, no way out. I have to do what they tell me to do until some opportunity presents itself."
 cmc_looking_for_entertainment:9 "Looking for Entertainment"
 cmc_looking_for_entertainment_desc:9 "After a night like that, everyone could use some distraction. What better way than a good movie. And i just know the place where we can get some.\nIf the future isn't bright, at least it's colourful."
 cmc_looking_for_an_escape:9 "Looking for an Escape"
 cmc_looking_for_an_escape_desc:9 "They say that there is money to be made in providing entertainment. The [TUB.GetName] have been in the business for a while. I am supposed to visit them to iron out a contract. They provide new movies and music, we provide money, the infrastructure and a way for them to spread their media empire. Of course I will be accompanied by my 'bodyguards'. Wouldn't want anything to happen to me, you know. We'll see."
 cmc_looking_for_love:9 "Looking for Love"
 cmc_looking_for_love_desc:9 "The visit turned out very different from what I expected. From what we both expected, I guess."
 cmc_another_night_to_remember:9 "Another Night to Remember"
 cmc_another_night_to_remember_desc:9 "Not every night that is worth remembering has to be as unpleasant as the last. This one was the very opposite of that."
 cmc_looking_for_revenge:9 "Looking for Revenge"
 cmc_looking_for_revenge_desc:9 "We came to an understanding. The 'technicians' that [TUB.GetLeader] will send back with my little entourage will pack more than the tools to set up some movie screens and broadcast towers. Once they are in place to secure the hostages, more are waiting just far enough away to avoid detection. \nI will reclaim my empire."

 cmc_open_casino_tt:9 "This will increase the number of fully running casinos by §G1§!."
 cmc_open_roadside_tt:9 "This will increase the number of open roadside attractions by §G1§!."

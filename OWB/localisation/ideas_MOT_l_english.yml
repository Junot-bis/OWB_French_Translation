  ncr_veg_treaty_of_new_vegas:0 "The Treaty of New Vegas"
  ncr_veg_treaty_of_new_vegas_desc:0 "Signed in 2274 by §Y[NCR.GetNameWithFlag]§! and §Y[VEG.GetNameWithFlag]§! after negotiations following the Republic's discovery of the mostly intact §OHoover Dam§!, the treaty marks the first of many begrudging compromises the Republic has been forced to make with Mr. House in an attempt to prepare for the Bull. Whilst the NCR gained control of the Dam through the treaty, as well as military access into and around New Vegas, they must send 5% of the Dam's energy to the Strip, and must not in any way prevent access to the Strip by NCR citizens or off-duty troops."

  mot_idea_support_from_shady_sands_desc:0 "Our campaign is reliant on a steady flow of troops, equipment and dollars from the government in Shady Sands. Whilst Shady Sands isn't going to just abandon the campaign anytime soon, if we can't produce results with the resources they've sunk into the area they may become less inclined to send fresh reinforcements."
  mot_idea_pacification_not_emancipation:0 "Pacification, Not Emancipation"
  mot_idea_pacification_not_emancipation_desc:0 "The Mojave Campaign is often dubbed the \"§OPacification of the Mojave§!\", and it got that nickname for a reason. Our campaign is primarily militarily motivated: it is our mission to clear the Mojave of raiders, tribes and other threats that stand opposed to the Republic. Sure, if we can help the locals that would be nice, but in this harsh wasteland we must look out for the Republic first and foremost."

  mot_idea_plan_the_offensive_desc:0 "It's time to tie together the various angles of attack and formulate a concrete plan. Shady Sands expects results!"
  mot_khan_raiders:0 "Great Khan Raids"
  mot_khan_raiders_desc:0 "The Great Khans, based just out of our reach past New Vegas, plague our lands with their warbands. They frequently clash with out troopers, and raid our factories. Something needs to be done about them, sooner rather than later."

  ncr_veg_treaty_of_new_vegas_tt:0 "Whilst the §OTreaty of New Vegas§! is in force, the NCR and its Mojave Expedition have a non-aggression pact in action between themselves and New Vegas. In exchange for guaranteed independence and sovereignty over the Strip, New Vegas must grant the Mojave Expedition military access in and around the city, with the exception of the Strip itself. §RWe cannot cancel any of the Treaty's stipulations individually.§!"

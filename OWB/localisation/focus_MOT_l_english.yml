  mot_protect_route_95_desc:0 "Route 95 is currently our only reliable road to transport supplies through the Mojave to the Hoover Dam and Boulder City. Should it fall to the Brotherhood, these forces in the north would be cut off. We must not let this happen."
  mot_promote_major_moore:0 "Promote Maj. Moore"
  mot_promote_major_moore_desc:0 "Major Cassandra Moore was a Ranger from a young age, serving the Republic loyally as it fought off raiders across California and surviving four tours during the Brotherhood-NCR war. Unfortunately, earlier this year Moore suffered a serious injury whilst garrisoned in the Mojave, meaning she can no longer fight on the fronts. However, she still possess a sharp mind and has a knack for battle tactics. We would be wise to make her a commander."

  mot_baker_militarisation_act:0 "Petition for the Baker Militarisation Act"
  mot_baker_militarisation_act_desc:0 "While massive military expansions are not technically beyond our remit, the town of Baker is technically still within the NCR. We should petition the NCR Congress for the Baker Militarisation Act, allowing us to bulk up military industry there."
  mot_divert_planners:0 "Divert Our Planning Focus"
  mot_divert_planners_desc:0 "We need to divert a large chunk of our planning efforts to the upcoming war. It may mean we lose some ground in our struggle against the raiders, but so be it."

  mot_establish_camp_forlorn_hope_desc:0 "The Forlorn Hope Springs are a strategically vital source of clean water in the Mojave, situated on the plateauing top of a small hill. By establishing a small military outpost, we can secure the water source and protect a portion of Route 95."
  mot_reinforce_camp_spotlight:0 "Reinforce Camp Searchlight"
  mot_reinforce_camp_spotlight_desc:0 "Shortly after the Battle for Nipton, we established Camp Searchlight in the crossroads town bearing the same name. Not only does the camp give us a vantage point over Nipton and Novac, but it also allows us to keep an eye on the Colorado to our East. Expanding the camp will help ensure we can hold onto the region against any who may threaten us."
  mot_the_nipton_deal:0 "The Nipton Deal"
  mot_the_nipton_deal_desc:0 "Nipton was largely untouched by the bombs of the Great War. As a result, a lively community still thrives in and around it: one far too large for us to control through martial law alone. If we were to make a deal with Nipton's Mayor, granting some autonomy in exchange for loyalty, we would gain compliance in the region."
  mot_the_second_campaign:0 "The Second Campaign"
  mot_the_second_campaign_desc:0 "In some ways, two battles need to be fought over the Mojave. The first to occupy the land. The second to win it. We may, de facto, have the Mojave under our ownership, but we are far from controlling swathes of it. The Committee is divided about how best to combat this."

  mot_the_i40:0 "Clear the I-40"
  mot_the_i40_desc:0 "While our campaign is primarily focused on the Northern Mojave and New Vegas, we must be sure not to forget about the Southern Mojave that lays between Baker and Needles. Much like the Long 15 that leads from Baker to New Vegas, the I-40 remains largely clogged by the wrecks of pre-war cars and trucks. With some work, we would be able to clear the worst of the congestion from the route, making travel to Needles significantly easier."
  mot_been_working_on_the_railway:0 "I've Been Working on the Railroad"
  mot_been_working_on_the_railway_desc:0 "Building a railway from Shady Sands to New Vegas has long been a great dream of General Oliver's. Not only would it be a propaganda victory, but it would also allow for the extremely quick redeployment of troops to New Vegas and the Hoover Dam from the NCR's heartland. The first part of the line, running from Baker alongside the Long 15, is relatively easy to construct due to our strong control over the area. Running a line through the Mojave, meanwhile, may be a bit more of an issue..."
  mot_cottonwood_port:0 "Bulk Up the Cottonwood Port"
  mot_cottonwood_port_desc:0 "Whilst the Long 15 acts as our main trade route back to the NCR, we could also run small-scale supply missions up the Colorado, from NCR outposts to the South. It wouldn't be ideal, but it may be useful in emergencies"
  mot_garrison_primm:0 "Garrison Primm"
  mot_garrison_primm_desc:0 "A pre-war mini-Vegas, Primm has experienced something of a resurgence following NCR occupation of the Mojave. A key trading town on the route to New Vegas, Primm is a strategic location well worth defending: indeed, should Nipton fall it could become a vital rally point."
  mot_bittersprings:0 "The March on Bittersprings"
  mot_bittersprings_desc:0 "For years the tribal raiders who call themselves the 'Great Khans' have plagued our territory. Based to the East of Vegas, in their camp known as 'Bittersprings', they think themselves safe from repurcussion. It's time to put an end to their foolery."
  mot_bittersprings_march_tt:0 "§gIt will take our soldiers a few days to march through the outskirts of New Vegas to launch their raid on Bittersprings. We'll recieve word when the commence their attack.§!"
  mot_act_now:0 "Act Now Or Forever Hold Our Peace"
  mot_act_now_desc:0 "The clash at Hoover Dam has left us jarred. We don't know how long we'll be able to hold on to the Mojave, but we need to assume the answer may not be forever. We need to hurry up and extract resources from the area, before it's too late."

  mot_assemble_the_mojave_defence_committee:0 "Assemble the Mojave Defence Committee"
  mot_assemble_the_mojave_defence_committee_desc:0 "The Mojave, or its population and strategic centres at least, now lie almost completely under our grasp. We now need to concern ourselves with keeping it that way. Enemies lie all around us, and there is some division within our ranks about how we should best prepare for future battles."
  mot_the_old_world_wall:0 "The Old World Wall"
  mot_the_old_world_wall_desc:0 "The Old World Wall: the Hoover Dam. For centuries it has stood as a testament to American engineering prowess, and has produced power for close to a dozen generations of American families. However, it possesses a critical flaw: it's appallingly indefensible. Whilst the original designers could be excused for not anticipating a battle fought on it's concrete, their shortsightedness has become something of a issue for the Defence Committee. Decisions are needed."
  mot_emergency_ctte_divide:0 "Emergency Committee: The Great Divide"
  mot_emergency_ctte_divide_desc:0 "Should something happen in the Divide to our supply routes, we will have to rapidly convene the Committee to decide on future strategy."
  mot_emergency_ctte_vegas:0 "Emergency Committee: The Fall of New Vegas"
  mot_emergency_ctte_vegas_desc:0 "Should New Vegas fall to powers unwilling to uphold the Treaty of New Vegas, the Committee must be convened to decide on our plan of response."
  mot_an_encouraging_victory:0 "An Encouraging Victory"
  mot_an_encouraging_victory_desc:0 "Our defeat of the stuck-up Brotherhood bastards in the Mojave has been a great boost to our standing amongst the NCR's people, and the government in shady sands. Needles to say, we can exploit this victory for more supplies."
  mot_lessons_from_the_war:0 "Lessons from War"
  mot_lessons_from_the_war_desc:0 "Whilst we were ultimately successful in our war against the Mojave Brotherhood sparked by Operation: Sunburst, it has taught us some much-needed lessons about our military tactics. We must adapt if we are to survive."
  mot_tools_left_behind:0 "Use the Tools Left Behind"
  mot_tools_left_behind_desc:0 "It seems the Brotherhood was tinkering about inside HELIOS One, presumably to restore its capacity as a power generating solar array. Our attack clearly caught them in the middle of their ambition, and as a result there's a number of pre-war tools inside the complex. Our engineers at the Hoover Dam would surely greatly appreciate it if we sent these their way."
  mot_the_heavy_corps:0 "Form the Heavy Corps"
  mot_the_heavy_corps_desc:0 "With the basic understanding of power armour we possess, we may be able to strip down the power armour recovered from Operation: Sunburst and train our men to use it. Heavily armoured assets will be invaluable against any primitive foe."
  mot_horrors_in_vault_3:0 "Horrors in Vault 3"
  mot_horrors_in_vault_3_desc:0 "We may control most of the Mojave, but one area remains beyond our control: Vault 3 and its surroundings. The Fiends, a vicious raider gang that once operated over most of the Mojave, holds it in an iron grasp. If we are to purge them from the wastes once and for all, we need to decide an overarching strategy."
  mot_consiglieres_diplomacy:0 "Consilglieres Diplomacy"
  mot_consiglieres_diplomacy_desc:0 "The Fiends are one of the founding families of New Vegas, but splinters from their family still inhabit Vault 3, and cling true to their raider ways. By doing a deal with Mr House and the Consilglieres, we could offer to remove this embarasing stain on the family and isolate them in Vault 3. We'll be avoiding a direct war, but the local area will be plagued by the Fiends for a while to come."
  mot_pushing_them_back:0 "Push Back the Scum"
  mot_pushing_them_back_desc:0 "We must dislodge the Fiends from the various harpoints they occupy in the North-West of the Mojave. We may not be able to crack Vault 3 itself, but we can at least mostly contain them if they're forced back into it."
  mot_victory_at_the_dam:0 "Victory at the Dam"
  mot_victory_at_the_dam_desc:0 "We have been successful in fending off the assault by Caesar's Legion on the Dam and Boulder City. It wasn't pretty, and it was more down to luck then we'd like to admit, but it's a victory."
  mot_the_long_march_home:0 "The Long March Home"
  mot_the_long_march_home_desc:0 "Despite the best efforts of our generals and countless NCR troopers, the Dam has fallen to a Legion assault. We must now make the long march home, and make some tough decisions about our future."
  mot_supply_and_demand:0 "Supply and Demand"
  mot_supply_and_demand_desc:0 "The Mojave is vast and desolate. To properly control it, we require a number of military bases crisscrossing the region, each requiring constant supply and reinforcement. Whilst we may have about enough supplies to keep our current outposts ticking over, if we are to expand our outposts, construct new ones or sufferer enemy espionage we may be unable to provide enough supplies to all our bases."
  mot_first_supply_shipment:0 "The First Supply Shipment"
  mot_first_supply_shipment_desc:0 "Delivered along the newly construced line from Baker to the Mojave Outpost, our first shipment of supplies from Shady Sands should keep us ticking over on supply nicely."
  mot_appoint_ambassador_crocker:0 "Appoint Ambassador Crocker"
  mot_appoint_ambassador_crocker_desc:0 "Following Ambassador Edith's retriement earlier this year from her role as Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the NCR Embassy in New Vegas, we need to find a suitable replacement. Under political pressure from Shady Sands, it seems we have only one possible candidate: Dennis Crocker. A career politician, Crocker led Kimball's successful campaign to sit on the NCR council. He at least seems a competent diplomat."
  mot_the_great_debate:0 "The Great Debate"
  mot_the_great_debate_desc:0 "For the months following the Battle for Hoover Dam, the Mojave Defence Committee has endlessly debated our strategy. Praise has landed on both Oliver's and Hanlon's heads, but so has extensive critisism. Discontent within the Committee is coming to a head, and only one of the two influental characters can lead the Expedition forwards."
  mot_promote_chief_hanlon:0 "General Oliver's Resignation"
  mot_promote_chief_hanlon_desc:0 "The Mojave Defence Committee has made its decision, and the majority of its members back Hanlon over Oliver. As a result Oliver has chosed to resign his position of General of the Mojave Expedition, and has reccomended Hanlon takes the title instead. At Hanlon's behest, however, Oliver will continue serving as a Field Marshal in the Mojave"
  mot_cement_olivers_authority:0 "Cement Oliver's Authorty"
  mot_cement_olivers_authority_desc:0 "Despite the posibility of a challenge from Hanlon, General Oliver has suceeded in retaining the confidence of the Mojave Defence Committee. The victory of his policy choices at recent Committee meetings has solidified his authority, ensuring he will continue to command the Expedition going forwards."
  mot_a_shared_vision:0 "A Shard Vision"
  mot_a_shared_vision_desc:0 "Despite many of their tactical differences, Hanlon and Oliver both share strategic visions for the Mojave, especially when it comes to competing with the Legion away from the Dam. Together, they make a formidable strategic team."
  mot_operation_bastion:0 "Warplan Bastion"
  mot_operation_bastion_desc:0 "General Hanlon knows one truth about the Mojave Expedition: no matter its backing from Shady Sands, there is just too much desert for the NCR's overextended conscript army to hold. Instead, Hanlon proposes a bold new strategic vision. Plan Bastion."
  mot_ncrs_finest:0 "The NCR's Finest"
  mot_ncrs_finest_desc:0 "It is only by relying on the men and women of the NCR's armed forces that we will prevail in our coming struggles. Manpower and training are everything, and in time we will have enough to defend the entire Mojave."

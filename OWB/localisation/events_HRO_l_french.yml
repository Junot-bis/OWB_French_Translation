 nf_houston.1.d:9 "Ever since the dissolution of the Military Council of 2273, Houston has been left with a meek governing body composed of some odd dozen high society figures. Recently, there has been calls for a new election for the position of Head Chairman, with small-scale riots breaking out in certain sections of Houston. \nTwo figures have been proposed. One of them, Mia Sanchez, is an upstart with her roots in her father's engineering company. The other is a militia captain named Abel Baptiste, heralded as a defender of the people after succesfully defending the The Mont from the Northern Raiders.\nThe two candidates could not be more different from each other. While Mia has grown up in the bustling core of Houston, Abel was raised on the outskirts of Libercity, still plagued with raiders. Mia has pioneered satellite harvestin data technology, while Abel only knows of satellites as what allows the troops to figure out their position. Mia is supported mostly by the elite of Houston, while Abel is supported by the common people.\nThe council must decide whether §Rthe Engineer§! or §Gthe People's Hero§! will lead the nation into the chaotic future."

    ATE_Might: "Meztia of Acapulco"

    ATE_Survivor_desc: "With the ashes of Camino a los Aztecas still in the air, the truth of the situation became plain to see. Mexico was not truely freed after the Great War, simply put in a cage by Tlaloc. Those who conformed closer to the \"Ideal\" mexico would be sheltered while the rest fought over the scraps. The mad king of Tlalocan and those who would claim his heritage must burn. "

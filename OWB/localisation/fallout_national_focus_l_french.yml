 ces_slaves_in_phoenix: "Esclaves à Phoenix"
 ces_slaves_in_phoenix_desc: "Toutes les choses sont échangées à Phoenix, parmi eux des esclaves. Transmis dans les terres des esclavagistes à Baja et plus au sud au Mexique, ces gens ne parlent pas notre langue, pourtant ils travaillent avec la volonté de gens qui désirent un jour retourner chez eux. On ne peut qu'espérer que cet effort demeure une fois que ces rêves sont écrasés."

 ces_two_sun_tribute_desc: "La ville de Two Sun nous a combattu pour leur liberté, et même maintenant? Ils en possèdent une partie.

 ces_two_sun_warcamp: "Base de Two Sun"
 ces_two_sun_warcamp_desc: "La Légion n'a pas de base permanente dans la ville de Twosun, encore pour rappeler à ces gens qu'ils vivent sous notre pouce, Caesar a ordonné la construction d'un camp militaire massif à moins d'un mile de la ville. C'est ici que nos hommages sont livrés, et c'est ici que de nombreux guerriers sont formés à l'art de la guerre."
 
 ces_enslave_tribals: "Asservir les Tribaux"
 ces_enslave_tribals_desc: "Les gens de Two Sun sont relativement à l'abri de la conscription légionnaire, pourtant les tribaux qui étaient sous leur protection sont les nôtres maintenant.

 ces_warcamp_slaves_desc: "Il a été décrété que ceux qui sont capables marcheront avec la légion. Ils devront réparer et créer de nouvelles armes, de l'armure et de l'équipement pour la Légion pendant son voyage. Chaque camp doit avoir une foule d'esclaves, qui existent à cette seule fin."

 ces_new_mexico_highways: "Autoroutes du Nouveau-Mexique"
 ces_new_mexico_highways_desc: "Les gens du Nouveau-Mexique ont été lents à s'agenouiller, et voyager à travers cet endroit est rude, même pour nos meilleurs guerriers et escrocs.

 ces_the_road_eastwards: "La route vers l'est"
 ces_the_road_eastwards_desc: "Les Terres du Nord ont été sécurisées, nous les ramènerons dans la main de la Légion. Laissez le commerce et les esclaves couler vers le sud, tout comme les armées coulent vers le nord. Dites-leur ce que signifie faire partie de quelque chose de plus grand."

 ces_pax_romana_desc: "La Légion est l'une des plus grandes, si ce n'est l'une des plus grandes civilisations qui existe dans ce nouveau monde, et le long de ses routes coulent des milliers de commerçants et de visiteurs.

 ces_general_silus: "Silus"
 ces_general_silus_desc: "La dévotion de Silus à la Légion est inébranlable, mais avant tout, il est un homme avec beaucoup de ruse. Assez intelligent pour impressionner même Caesar, et s'engager, dans la danse délicate du débat avec notre grand chef."
 
 ces_servus_publicus: "Servus Publicus"

 bos_justice: "Justice"
 bos_justice_desc: "On October 10th 2077, less than a week before nuclear fire destroyed all that was and had been, Robert Maxson and his followers descended upon the West-Tech facility in hopes of finding resources and supplies. Instead, they found a freakshow, a nightmarish realm of FEV and mad scientists. Robert was furious, and what he decided to do with these mad men would echo through the centuries."
 
 bos_glow: "The Glow"
 bos_glow_desc: "In 2134, after the formal formation of the Brotherhood of Steel, a splinter faction lead by Dennis Allen, who was among Maxson's original soldiers, requested permission to return to the West-Tek facility in search of technological artifacts. Understanding fully that this was the most dangerous mission ever presented to the council, he trusted his good reputation to garner him permission."

 bos_vipers: "The Vipers"
 bos_vipers_desc: "The War with the Vipers was a skirmish like any other, routine patrols engaging in small and one sided firefights with random raider gangs. But this time it was different, this time there were casualties. Maxson himself died hours after the engagement, writing in pain as radscorpion venom claimed him. This painful and horrific death lead to outrage among the Brotherhood of Steel."

 bos_oldamerica: "Old America"
 bos_oldamerica_desc: "The Brotherhood was not the only pre-war military outfit to survive the end of America, and that became overwhelmingly apparent with the rise of the Enclave. After years of passive observation and subtle maneuvering, the Brotherhood of Steel joined the RNC in the final battle at the Navarro Outpost. This was in many ways, the opening of a new Chapter for the Brotherhood of Steel."

 # Underground Hangars sub-tree

 bos_hangars: "Underground Hangars"
 bos_hangars_desc: "Some Pre-War Military Bunkers come equipped with Underground Hangers, from with Vertibirds can ascend and descend in relative safety and obscurity. Many of these facilities also come with facilities for repair and ample fuel storage. Bringing them back online is necessary for power protection."

 bos_fighters: "Fighter Development"
 bos_fighters_desc: "Numerous  Air Bases contain the apparatus for training pilots, but training such people is pointless without the necessary machines. Follower order from the Council, numerous Paladin squads have been sent out into thes Terres Désolées to identify and recover information necessary to repair the wrecked fighters of the old world."

 bos_support: "Support Tactics"
 bos_support_desc: "In the last age, integrated air force tactics were all but essential, with bombers and strafing  runs existing to support ground infantry in almost every engagement. Ideally, any faction that could master and reintroduce such tactics intos Terres Désolées combat would gain an overwhelming advantage, but to do this? One must first uncover planes with the capcity for such support, and repair them.`"

 bos_airlexicon: "Air Combat Lexicon"
 bos_airlexicon_desc: "Our efforts in thes Terres Désolées have not gone unrewarded! Deep within the remains of an air force facility, a singular robrain was discovered, struggling to maintain an archive of tactics and regulations former employed by the US Air Force. With his blessing, we were able to make a copy of this information for use in the future."
 
 bos_behemoths: "Air Behemoths"
 bos_behemoths_desc: "The Superiority fighters of the Old World are overwhelmingly powerful, and iRNCedibly difficult to maintain. With intense fuel and ammunition requirements, many in the Brotherhood argue that that their combat effectiveness is far outweighed by the cost of producing them."

 bos_bombers: "Fortress Bombers"
 bos_bombers_desc: "The Fortress Bombers of the Old World are a nightmare to behold, a bustling fortress of machine gun nests and auto turrets to protect a payload capable of leveling all but the most fortified position. They are costly, but few can deny their viability in this new age. The ability to destroy foes without any risk of retaliation is appealing to all."

 bos_scourge: "Scourge"
 bos_scourge_desc: "In the past, the Brotherhood of Steel has made ample use of blimps as transport craft, but only recently has the novel idea of using them as floating weapons platforms come to mind. Such an undertaking would require an overwhelming understanding of their situational uses, and an in depth knowledge of all technologies leading up to this revelation."

 bos_harbours: "San-Francisco Harbor"
 bos_harbours_desc: "The Harbors of San-Francisco once played host to hundreds of massive ships from all around the world, military or otherwise, the shells of which still rest in ruined dockyards. Clearing out these wrecks, combined with a number of basic repair practices, could open up innumerable staging points for our budding naval forces."

 bos_seatrials: "Sea Trials"
 bos_seatrials_desc: "Encounters at sea are rare, but not entirely unheard of. Coast raiders prowel the shallow waters in vessels to fast to be caught in larger ships. The generally agreed upon answer to this is a small fleet of agile ships with which to capture and disarm any such foes."

 bos_navallexicon: "Naval Tactics Lexicon"
 bos_navallexicon_desc: "Using information given to us by a Ghoul who claims to be a former US Admiral, we have begun to compile information on naval tactics and the rules of engagement in a rough naval Lexicon, which shall become the basis for our approach to naval combat for decades to come."

 bos_screening: "Screening Vessels"
 bos_screening_desc: "Encounters at sea are rare, but not entirely unheard of. The RNC Patrol their extensive coast with a small fleet of heavier ships, coast vessels that are designed to scare off, not engage, raider vessels. If we are ever to challenge them at sea, we will need larger ships of our own."

 bos_seabehemoths: "Sea Behemoths"

 bos_navarro: "Navarro or Nothing"
 bos_navarro_desc: "Control of Navarro base was the singular grand reward for the Brotherhood following the battle of Navarro. The RNC has always rejected and loathed that we gained it in the following peace agreements, and will certainly seek to reclaim it. The word from the Elders is thus! Navarro or Nothing!"

 bos_citadel: "Citadel of Steel"
 bos_citadel_desc: "The Brotherhood of Steel has not been tested in combat like this in many long years, an open war against foes who have the capacity to finally defeat us. We must be a Citadel of Steel against the hordes of the RNC. Unbreakable and defiant."

 bos_newsteel: "New Steel"

 bos_ghouls: "Ghoul Recruitment"
 bos_ghouls_desc: "Although it is heavily protested, man within the Brotherhood feel that desperate times call for desperate measures. The RNC has alienated ghouls in uncountable numbers over the last few decades, many of whom would happily side with us, if only to stick it to the RNC once and for all."

 bos_victoryforge: "Forge of Victory"
 bos_victoryforge_desc: "The Forge of War has left us stronger than ever, and with a refined need for things we often forsook, such as our civilian manufacturing and general economy. Using what resources we can spare, we push for great development."

 # Internal Restructuring sub-tree

 bos_restructure: "Internal Restructuring"
 bos_restructure_desc: "The Brotherhood of Steel has had trouble with manpower for decades, due in no small part to a general refusal to accept outside aid. However, it is becoming iRNCeasingly obvious that such things are unviable, and that we shall have to change as thes Terres Désolées changes."

 bos_outsiders: "Outsider Recruitment"
 bos_outsiders_desc: "The recruitment of outsiders, those loyal too and who have expressed interest in joining the Brotherhood of Steel, is the first and most step for our push for recruitment. Although they are resented by many outside of our organization, these outsides will help to flesh out the ranks."

 boss Terres Désoléesconscripts: s Terres Désolées Conscription"
 boss Terres Désoléesconscripts_desc: "Perviously,s Terres Désolées Conscription has been something that only the most desperate of Elders consider, as demanding able bodied men and women from those townships that we defend is considered primitive and overtly tyrannical to most within the organization."

 bos_techreallocation: "Tech Reallocation"
 bos_techreallocation_desc: "Even the Brotherhood lacks perfect logistics, and vast quantities of technology are left to waste away in storehouses and bunkers. Rechecking the books and making sure that little is wasted will carry us far."

 bos_advancedcommunication: "Advanced Communication"
 bos_advancedcommunication_desc: "As strange as it sounds, most groups within thes Terres Désolées don't even attempt basic eRNCyption on their files and valuable documents. The Brotherhood on the other hand, is constantly improving their firewalls and coding methods to be certain that only those who are meant to understand understand."

 bos_surfacetensions: "Surface Tensions"
 bos_surfacetensions_desc: "For decades, the Brotherhood of Steel has refuses to engage in outside activities, often leading the people of thes Terres Désolées out on a limb when it comes too protection in favor of more lucrative operations gathering technology. This has not only hurt our public image, but our moral as a force for good. It is time for the Brotherhood of Steel to again be proactive."

# Old Bonds sub-tree

 bos_oldbonds: "Old Bonds"
 bos_oldbonds_desc: "The Brotherhood and RNC have stood by each other in the past, if only because both are bastions of civilization in this harshs Terres Désolées. Yet now, the RNC is threatened by a foe unlike any other, a horde of raiders and fiends so massive that even the might RNC buckles under the pressure. If California is to survive, we must act."

 bos_logistics: "Logistical Support"
 bos_logistics_desc: "The RNC take pride in their logistical support, gods know why. It's a mess, and they seem to lack all but the most basic of structuring. Simple advice and minor upgrades on their communication networks should make them a force to be reckoned with."

 bos_recruitment: "Recruitment Drive"
 bos_recruitment_desc: "The Legion is a foe without number, we shall need fresh paladins and soldiers if we are to face them in any effective capacity."

 bos_RNCforge: "RNC Forge"
 bos_RNCforge_desc: "Massive amounts of long hoarded wealth and technology are being channeled into the RNC's war effort, and their economy is buckling under the pressure. It has been suggested by several Elders that we go forth and reinforce the heart of the RNC's industry, Shady Sands, so that it might better stand against the tide."

 # Common Ground with Savages sub-tree

 bos_commonground: "Common Ground with Savages"
 bos_commonground_desc: "The Tribes of Umbra, far to the north, remain some of the last independent people in all of California. Yet even now, the RNC moves to civilize or evict these people. For the sake of sequering expansions in the north, they should be brought into our sphere of influence."

 bos_union: "Camaraderie Union"
 bos_union_desc: "The Chosen One, who rules Arroyo, once saved thes Terres Désolées with our aid. As such, we have remained on good terms with them and their people ever since. Mayhaps it is time to call upon such good graces, and bring them into the fold? An buffer state to the chaos in the north, and a limiter to the RNC's relentless expansionism."

 bos_seize: "Seize Arroyo"
 bos_seize_desc: "Why use words when force will do? The people of Arroyo are weak by far, and while we could bring them into an alliance, we would do far better by simply taking their resources and equipment as our own. They could do little to stop us, if we decided to march upon them."

 bos_homefront: "Trouble on the Homefront"
 bos_homefront_desc: "Tensions with the Shi have never been particularly good, but what can one expect when two technological powerhouses live so closely to one another? It is only by our good graces that they retain control over their own advanced weaponry and technology, although recent events now threaten this mutual understanding."

 bos_scrapsilicon: "Scrap Silicon Valley"
 bos_scrapsilicon_desc: "Silicon Valley has been explored by Brotherhood scouts and scribes for decades, in the hopes of finding new and rare technology. However, in recent years it has become overwhelmingly apparent that what the Brotherhood needs may simple be resources. Do we change the objective of the most recent expedition?"

 bos_exploresilicon: "Explore Silicon Valley"

 bos_strip: "Strip the Sub"
 bos_strip_desc: "The hollowed out remains of the Sub that brought the Shi to America have been resting in the harbor for decades now, a source of high quality, but hard to reach military grade steel and metal. The recovery and scrapping of this vessel could lead to a reasonable cache of resources."

 bos_slums: "Develop the Slums"
 bos_slums_desc: "The people of the Bay Area have long suffered from what one would expect. A lack of clean water, dedicated crime, and shoddy housing. Taking the time to render aid to these people could ensure long term loyalty to the Brotherhood, and give us just cause to place a series of high quality water filters in the area."

 bos_destroy: "Destroy Hubology"
 bos_destroy_desc: "The Hubologists have been wasting technology for decades now. Suicidal rocket experiments, attempts to civilize robots, and other innumerable inane projects that have only ended in disaster. They have squandered an incalculable amount of technology in their insane pursuit, but no more!"

 bos_civillians: "Encourage Civilian Business"
 bos_civillians_desc: "The people of the Bay are often fearful when it comes to opening storefronts or attempting to form anything resembling a business, because such things are often prime targets for raiders and gangs. However, with the promise of Brotherhood protection, we could usher in a new generation of Civilians loyal to the Brotherhood of Steel."

 bos_curbstomp: "Curb Raider Aggression"
 bos_curbstomp_desc: "The Raiders of the Bay Area have been a thorn in the side of the Brotherhood of Steel's operations for decades now, between harassing our patrols and smuggling out rare resources and equipment before we can get our hands on them, it has become apparent that they are something we need to deal with."

 bos_expand: "Expand Private Industry"
 bos_expand_desc: "Part of ensuring the safety of any given area is making sure that people are well armed and capable of protecting themselves when our patrols are not present. As such, developing the private arms industry in the bay area is necessary for our continued PR attempts."

 bos_steelrain: "Steel Rain"
 bos_steelrain_desc: "For too long have we struggled with and against the Shi. Their technocratic ways and willingness to tolerate crime in our area of influence have made it clear to man within the hierarchy of the Brotherhood that they are opposed to our goals, and as such, must be brought to heel."

 bos_shichapter: "Establish the Shi Chapter"
 bos_shichapter_desc: "The Shi could easily be conquered by our forces, but many within the brotherhood fear that such a choice of action would lead to the mass destruction of their secretive technological archives. Instead, an alternative method has been proposed... why not simply invite them to join us?"

 bos_demand: "Demand the Bay"
 bos_demand_desc: "Our recent show of force against the Shi has shaken the mighty RNC. We could make use of this moment and attempt to demand the RNC owned section of the Bay Area, Point-Green."

 bos_emperor: "Audience with the Emperor"
 bos_emperor_desc: "The Emperor of the Shi has deemed us worth of a formal meeting, following the founding of our chapter. He is a marvelous machine, and while many are uncomfortable with the presence of this AI, many more are eager to hear the secrets he could teach us."

 bos_shisecrets: "Stolen Secrets"
 bos_shisecrets_desc: "The ground infantry of the Shi bring with them advance Gauss Weaponry, the likes of which can't be produced anywhere else in thes Terres Désolées. By controlling their areas of manufacturing, we can take such weapons from their producers."

 bos_shiseize: "Seize the Military"
 bos_shiseize_desc: "What remains of the Shi Military has surrendered, but could still have a purpose within the Brotherhood. Although they are resentful, many of them were merely conscripted by the Shi, and should be manageable with the transition to new leadership."

 bos_gauss: "Gauss Weapons"
 bos_gauss_desc: "The secrets of Gauss have been gifted to us by the Emperor himself, his cherished weapons offered as a symbol of friendship and continued alliance. Maybe he's worried we'd betray him if he didn't attempt to placate us? Either way, our gain."

 bos_vertibirds: "Vertibird Schematics"
 bos_vertibirds_desc: "The Vertibird Schematics stolen from the Enclave many years ago have been a long coveted secret of the Shi, who haven't entirely managed to master the air of their manufacturing. Howevering, by combining our knowledge, we shall surely gain understanding that rivals even that of the former Enclave."

 # Mojave Veterans sub-tree

 bos_mojavevets: "Mojave Veterans"
 bos_mojavevets_desc: "The men and women of the Mojave Chapter are among our most distant relatives, due in no small part to a lack of communication and understanding. That being said, even they are willing to answer the calling, sending volunteers when the Brotherhood calls."

 bos_mojavesignal: "The Mojave Signal"
 bos_mojavesignal_desc: "For the longest time, the primary issue barring us from active communication with our Brothers in the Mojave has been their fault communication equipment, which is largely incapable of long distance signaling. The delivery of some of our own equipment to them should help to ease this burden."

 bos_genius: "Elijah's Genius"
 bos_genius_desc: "Elder Elijah is a controversial figure on the best of days, due to his overt interest in the persuit of wonder weapons and technological miriacles that he feels can save thes Terres Désolées. He is the embodiment of our ideals in their most extreme, and is willing to throw away anything for technology."

 bos_hardin: "Hardin's Tactics"
 bos_hardin_desc: "Head Paladin Hardin is the man that the vast majority of Elders now wish had been elected to take over the Mojave Chapter, if only because many suspect that the genius of Elijah has been wasted. Hardin is the man's man, a Paladin who honors the tactics and ideals of the Brotherhood, while also understanding the necessity of political flexibility."

 bos_foodforservice: "Food for Service"
 bos_foodforservice_desc: "The Mojave Brotherhood have had been hoarding ancient pieces of technology and data that could drastically improve the quality of life for farmers in rougher areas. Requesting these could give us leverage when it comes to conscription."

 bos_drills: "Boxing Drills"
 bos_drills_desc: "Hardin is classical in more ways than one, and his insistence on basic hand to hand training for all soldiers is considered to be subtle genius in the eyes of many elders. Instilling the habit of sporting combat in our warriors makes them more capable of taking and recovering blows, and more likely to maintain fitness without prodding."

 bos_software: "Study Securitron Software"
 bos_software_desc: "Elijah has spent decades working on reverse engineering the works of Doctor House, not the least of which has involved taking apart and analyzing what it is that makes Securitrons more capable than the average robot. "

 bos_mojaveequip: "Mojave Equipment"
 bos_mojaveequip_desc: "The Mojave Brotherhood of Steel works in what might be the most inhospitable heat imaginable, and have developed a number of specialized weapon maintenance routines to keep their weapons in working order."

 bos_hardware: "Study Securitron Hardware"
 bos_hardware_desc: "Years of taking Securitrons apart has given Elijah a deep insight into many of a secrets and techniques used by Robco to outdo their rivals. As the Securitrons were among the most advanced robots ever created by Pre War America."

 bos_logisticaltech: "Logistical Technology"
 bos_logisticaltech_desc: "Due in part to their deep tendency to resort to deep reconnaissance behind enemy lines, the men and women under Hardin’s command can easily teach us how to do more with less. Supplies are everything to a soldier in the field."

 bos_plantations: "Industrial Plantations"
 bos_plantations_desc: "Elijah has requested that we provide him with the fixings necessary to expand his own industry and general logistical capacity. Providing him with such will continue to earn this wildcard’s loyalty."

 bos_militia: "Organised Militia"
 bos_militia_desc: "Hardin is more willing that most members of the Brotherhood to resort to taking outside help, and getting involved in outside conflicts. To this end, we find that he has garnered the attention and adoration of a number of smaller militia groups, some of whom he is willing to send to us."

 bos_recallelder: "Elder Recalled"
 bos_recallelder_desc: "The Mojave Chapter has operated as a Semi-Independent entity for far too long now, recalling their Elder to meet with the council should hopefully remind them who it is they server, and bring them back into the fold of our overall goals."

 bos_viperlogs: "Viper Combat Logs."
 bos_viperlogs_desc: "The first true conflict we ever engaged in was our Viper Conflict, which took the life of Elder Maxson and in many ways, introduced us to the horrifying zeal of somes Terres Désolées factions. To this day, we analyze these conflicts again and again, so that we might never forget these lessons."

 bos_armmaxson: "Arm Maxson."
 bos_armmaxson_desc: "The state of Maxson is where we draw the vast majority of our lesser conscripts, who are unworthy of our more advanced equipment. That being said, developing our ability to arm them in ways comparable or superior to the RNC is a necessary element of our self-defense."

 bos_reactionchambers: "Laser Focus Foundry."

 bos_navarrotacticaldata: "Navarro Tactical Data."
 bos_navarrotacticaldata_desc: "The tactical information gained from the War with the Enclave give the Brotherhood of Steel something it had never before had to deal with. Battle with a technologically superior foe. Teaching our soldiers to be more reliant on their combat abilities, instead of depending on superior technology."

 bos_supplymaxson: "Supply Maxson."
 bos_supplymaxson_desc: "The men and women of Maxson are our first line against invasion, the shield that allows the hammer of the Brotherhood of Steel to fall upon a foe. Supplying them with firearms and the ability to make their own is an essential piece of defensive stratagem."

 bos_simplified: "Simplified Designs."
 bos_simplified_desc: "The Common Laser Rifle has been the reliable companion to the Brotherhood of Steel for many generations. While many within the organization are pushing towards newer weapons, the older weapons are more than sufficient when it comes to dealing with any foe. "

 bos_oldworld: "Old World Focuses."

However, the RNC is in a unique position to gather and make use of such weapons; something Drummund fully intends to do."
 
 RNC_mobile:0 "Army of Mobility "
 RNC_mobile_desc:0 "The ability to move troops and supplies from place to place is a key feature in any army, and while the RNC has some capacity to do this, it is currently treated as an afterthought to be used in choice situations, rather than as an element of core RNC doctorine. This must be remedied if the RNC is to push forward militarily."
 
 RNC_spear:0 "The Tip of the Spear "
 RNC_spear_desc:0 "Drummund has spent decades collecting information from scattered libraries and military instillations, exploring the usage of the now elusive tank through the ages. Warfare in thes Terres Désolées, and the limited volume of tanks has made the vast majority of these tactics invalid, yet it has also given Drummund the insight needed to formulate his own new doctorine of vehicular warfare."
 
 RNC_jim:0 "Big Jim's Army "
 RNC_jim_desc:0 "Big Jim is not a particularly complicated man when it comes to tactic, he values bravery and loyalty in his troops above any particular strategy or methodology. In many ways, this makes Big Jim's army overwhelmingly inflexible, but at the end of the day? The introduction of simple drills once taught to him by the Desert Ranger should allow the RNC's average soldier to rise to new heights."
 
 RNC_drills:0 "Infantry Drills"
 RNC_drills_desc:0 "As odd as it may seem, one of the first things the Big Jim elected to do after being appoint as leader of the RNC's military was to reinevent the wheel when it came to their iRNCedibly rudimentary infantry drills. The integration of simple squad tactics and more complicated marksmanship and urban assault tactics should have a marked improvement on the average soldier in the RNC's Military."
 
 RNC_march:0 "Military March "
 RNC_march_desc:0 "The marching drills of Big Jim have been met with resounding frustration from the average soldier, who loaths the idea of marching for days on end even after one has met the physical requirements. The point of these exersizes is to iRNCease the overall mobility of infantry as a unit, rather than individuals. This standardization of mobility and iRNCeased milage on foot soldiers is a general boon."
 
 RNC_draft:0 "The Big Jim Draft"
 RNC_draft_desc:0 "The Big Jim Draft is something few people actually expected to see, as many in the RNC feel that conscription is one of the leading issues in relation to the quality of the RNC's military forces, yet as Jim's Doctorine stresses the importance of overwhelming numbers of high quality infantry, the need to enlist more men and women, willing or otherwise, is a necessity."
 
 RNC_rangergenmossman:0 "Mossman's Army"
 RNC_rangergenmossman_desc:0 "Ranger General Mossman has something of a distain for the average soldier in the RNC, and views them as an awkward, blunt tool, better for pinning an enemy down than actually accomplishing anything in particular. To this end, he believes in the expansion and iRNCeased importance of the Rangers, and instead puts much of his funding towards improving them."
 
 RNC_rangercore:0 "The New Ranger Core"

 RNC_rangerlead:0 "Rangers Lead the Way"
 RNC_rangerlead_desc:0 "Rangers are, above all other things, special forces capable of infilitration and reconnaissance. Ranger General Mossman employs a relatively simple approach to large scale engagement, one that involves using rangers to scout ahead of a main body of infantry in order to assess the ideal location for an engagement and to counter any and all moves and enemy might make."
 
 RNC_rangercanopeners:0 "Ranger can-openers"
 RNC_rangercanopeners_desc:0 "Ranger General Mossman, like many within the RNC Rangers, feel that the brotherhood of steel are easily the most dangerous threat that the RNC faces to this date, a thorn in the side of the republic who use their advanced technology to bully the commonfolk of the RNC. To this end, special drills and tactics are being developed by the Rangers, informally referred too as can opener techniques."
 
 RNC_mechcore:0 "Mechanized Core"
 RNC_mechcore_desc:0 "The RNC is one of the few nations in the world capable of sustaining a sizable fleet of support vehicles and motorized support.

 RNC_shock:0 "Shock Companies"
 RNC_shock_desc:0 "The introduction of the APC to the RNC's military could be a gamechanger in wars against more powerful foes, such as the Legion or the Brotherhood of Steel.

 RNC_rapid:0 "Rapid Advance Doctorine"

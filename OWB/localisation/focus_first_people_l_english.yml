  fp_history_1: "The Smoke and the Fire"
  fp_history_1_desc: "When the Bombs dropped, we were prepared. A collective effort of all of our people brought together funding, scientific knowledge, engineering prowess and spiritual guidance to keep us save underground while the smoke and the fire washed over the earth."
  fp_history_2: "Emerging from the Earth Once More"
  fp_history_2_desc: "As our earliest ancestors emerged from the ground in the time of legends to claim these lands, so did we once more."
  fp_history_3: "The Accord"
  fp_history_3_desc: "Separate in land, but together in spirit. We wrote down everything we needed to guide our nations into the future."

  fp_industry: "Addressing the Local Situation"
  fp_industry_desc: "If we want to continue to improve, we need to curry favour with one (or all) of the major groups in our nation. We have some options on how to accomplish this."
  fp_industry_tt: "§gYou can gain a total of 12 points of support for the two factions in your nation in this branch. These are required later to unlock more focuses. Plan ahead accordingly so you don't lock yourself out of something you might want.§!"
  fp_support_clans: "Support the Clans"
  fp_support_clans_desc: "A significant part of the people of our nation lives in rural areas and is largely self-governed and self-sustaining. We need to reassure them our decisions won't negatively impact their way of life, while also trying to bring them closer into the fold. We can't be a powerful nation during these times if everyone is doing what they want."
  fp_support_cities: "Support the City Dwellers"
  fp_support_cities_desc: "The City Dwellers are more in line with our goal of a strong unified nation. To gain favour with them comes mostly down to shaking the right hands and making the right promises."
  fp_improve_clan_housing: "Improve Clan Housing"
  fp_reclaim_skyscrapers: "Reclaim the Skyscrapers"
  fp_reclaim_skyscrapers_desc: "Even though the City Dwellers live, as the name suggests, in the cities, very few of the pre-war skyscrapers and high-rises are actually inhabited. This is due to the often dreadful state of especially their upper floors. 200 years of the elements beating on those buildings led to missing walls, collapsed floors and various other issues. If we fix just some of them, we will open a lot of space for further ventures."
  fp_clan_farmsteads: "Subsidize Clan Farmsteads"
  fp_clan_farmsteads_desc: "Giving a healthy cash infusion to the various independent farmsteads will allow them to produce more, giving them the option of selling the surplus back to the market, which in turn allows us to support a larger population. Everybody wins."
  fp_free_streets: "Clear the Streets of Rubble"
  fp_free_streets_desc: "In some of our cities getting from point A to point B is a serious struggle due to collapsed buildings and various other debris blocking streets and walkways. If we don't want people to make a short trip through the sewers, up and down a three story building and slide down a zip line just to buy food one street over, we need to do something about that."
  fp_black_drink_bottling_plant: "Open a Black Drink Bottling Plant"
  fp_black_drink_bottling_plant_desc: "The Black Drink is a traditional caffeinated beverage of our people. If we can brew it on a larger scale and bottle it, we can sell it to people as a fresh new alternative to the local pre-war favourites Bawls or maybe even Nuka Cola. We should consider getting rid of the whole vomiting after drinking it bit though. That aspect would probably hurt the bottom line."
  fp_organized_scavenging_teams: "Organized Scavenging Teams"
  fp_organized_scavenging_teams_desc: "There are a lot of pieces of machinery and vehicles in varying states of functionality just lying around our cities. Unused and unclaimed. We need to send out dedicated teams of scavengers and mechanics to comb everything we own for anything that can be either repaired or repurposed."
  fp_reopen_coal_mines: "Reopen Coal Mines"
  fp_reopen_coal_mines_desc: "While the petroleum and gas deposits have been drained long before the Great War, a lot of the regional coal mines are still workable. Since they tend to be on the outskirts of urbanized areas they often fall into territory claimed by one of the clans. Reopening them will give us a good supply of fuel and other components and bring good work to those areas."
  fp_fund_local_arms_factories: "Fund Local Arms Factories"
  fp_fund_local_arms_factories_desc: "The clans tend to have their own weapon smiths and forges. They usually produce high quality goods, but don't have the output to supply larger forces with enough equipment. Funding them to provide them with the necessary manpower and tools they need to ramp up production will help them prosper and give us another source of weaponry."
  fp_traditional_values: "Traditional Values"
  fp_repair_industrial_complexes: "Repair Industrial Complexes"
  fp_hunt_down_weapon_stashes: "Hunt Down Weapon Stashes"
  fp_the_new_expansion: "The New Expansion"
  fp_dismantle_old_bunkers: "Dismantle the Old Bunkers"
  fp_dismantle_old_bunkers_desc: "The Bunkers in which our people survived the Great War have stopped serving their purpose a long time ago. Some were kept around after for sentimental reasons, as monuments or simply as warehouses. But we need to look to the future instead of the past and they will serve a way better use as a source of construction material and equipment than dusty mementos of a past long gone."
  fp_new_world_tactics: "New World Tactics"
  fp_new_world_tactics_desc: "While moving some of the old holotape recorders we found one that had a master reel in it with loads of information about large scale troop warfare, strategies and planning. While a lot has to be adapted to the current state of the world, most of it will be very useful to us."
  fp_old_world_knowledge: "Old World Knowledge"
  fp_old_world_knowledge_desc: "Amidst boxes with dirty and water stained papers that were entirely useless to us we found a sealed metal box containing solid instructional information about how to build a lot of electronic equipment from scratch. Lucky find."
  fp_weapons_fit_for_the_wastes: "Weapons Fit for the Wastes"
  fp_weapons_fit_for_the_wastes_desc: "A lot of the more high end weaponry of yesteryear is not sturdy enough to sustain the environment of the wasteland for a longer period of time. We may need to look back to more simpler constructions that are easier to produce and to maintain."
  fp_future_of_war: "The Future of War from the Past"
  fp_future_of_war_desc: "While simpler weapons may be more reliable, no one can deny the feeling of power you gain by shooting someone in the face with a superheated ball of brightly glowing plasma."
  fp_bunker_research_slot: "A Functioning Mainframe"
  fp_bunker_research_slot_desc: "Clearly the biggest find we had in the process of dismantling the bunker was that the mainframe installed into it was fully functional, if powered down. If we move all of the important bits to a more accessible place and power it up, this will be a big boon to everything that requires efficient data storage and processing, like our research. There isn't even an evil AI running on it...probably"

  fp_the_joint_focus_tt: "§gThe corresponding focus will also be completed for the other original members of the §YFirst Peoples Federation§!§!.\n\n"
  fp_the_joint_focus_bonus_tt: "§gThe nation that completes this focus for all members will also get the following bonus:§!"
  fp_the_joint_focus_bonus_event_tt: "§gThe nation that completes this focus for all members will also get a bonus based on the event outcome.§!"

  fp_the_alliance: "Revisit the Accord of First People's Junction"
  fp_the_alliance_desc: "While our nations have worked together for a long time now, large scale cooperative projects were a rare thing. Maybe it's time to change that."
  fp_lacrosse: "The Little Brother of War"
  fp_combined_militia_effort: "Combined Militia Efforts"
  fp_fortify_the_borders: "Fortify the Borders"
  fp_shared_education: "Schooling for Everyone"
  fp_shared_education_desc: "Having a unified federation-wide education system will not only help us combat issues like poor literacy and an untrained workforce, but also will raise a new generation of bright minds that will accelerate our research projects."
  first_peoples_federation_sharing: "First Peoples Federation Education System"
  fp_into_the_PIT: "Into the PIT"
  fp_into_the_PIT_desc: "Our shared education system was a good start, but we need a central place to send our best and brightest people to. The Plains Commonwealth Institute for Technology, colloquially called 'The Pit', was such a place before the war. Maybe we can make it one again. If we manage to clear out all raiders and rad roaches that have claimed it since, that is."
  fp_clear_out_PIT_raiders: "Clear out the Raiders"
  fp_clear_out_PIT_raiders_desc: "A unpleasant fellow calling himself the 'Lord of the Pit' and his gang have made their home in the abandoned PIT. Over the years they remade the former place of learning into a veritable fortress. A joint effort between our nations militaries is necessary to oust him from that place."
  fp_the_archives: "Comb the Archives"
  fp_the_archives_desc: "Why did the PIT staff decide to store so much data on punch cards? We get the feeling that the PIT was seriously underfunded, if they couldn't even afford a decent amount of consumer grade holodisk machines. The punch cards are beyond any attempt to salvage them, but the few holodisks they had luckily survived intact. We should distribute them among our nations, so they can be used as efficiently as possible."
  fp_usable_equipment: "Share the Spoils"
  fp_usable_equipment_desc: "We found a couple of prototypes and improved versions of every day use machinery and devices from before the war. While the machines themselves don't work anymore, we did learn some valuable lessons from dismantling and inspecting them."

 nf_vegas.1.t:0 "The Great War"
 nf_vegas.1.d:0 "There was only ever one constant in Vegas, and it was change. I was almost fully prepared to prevent the apocalypse from touching my desert jewel, but without the Platinum Chip, I couldn't stop every missile."
 nf_vegas.1.a:0 "I prioritized protecting the suburbs in the few seconds I had to spare"
 nf_vegas.1.b:0 "My laser defences targeted missiles headed for military industry"

 nf_vegas.2.t:0 "Unstable System"
 nf_vegas.2.d:0 "Without the Platinum Chip, I couldn't upgrade my Securitrons or my defences. Numerous power cuts, rampant data corruption, and a coma were the result of my failure. I was faced with a painful choice, reusing an older and very stable version of my prewar OS, or attempting to salvage and use an incomplete OS, which was designed to be more capable of addressing wasteland threats."
 nf_vegas.2.a:0 "I reinstalled a much older and stable version of my OS."
 nf_vegas.2.b:0 "I took a risk and attempted to salvage parts of the incomplete OS."

 nf_vegas.3.t:0 "Selecting the Pawns"
 nf_vegas.3.d:0 "Before the war, Las-Vegas was a city of dreams, where fortunes were won and lost in an instant. To recapture that feeling and reap the profits, to draw a crowd from across the wasteland with bright neon lights... I need to reopen the casinos, and they needed families to run them."
 nf_vegas.3.a:0 "Vegas shall become the shining jewel of humanity's future"

 nf_vegas.4.t:0 "Reopening Gomorrah"
 nf_vegas.4.d:0 "Gomorrah was a thriving casino before the Great War. Its faux-Persian decor and sex appeal made it a popular destination. In the new age, I desire a criminal element within Vegas; not simply for the nostalgia, but because a thriving black market makes business better for all of us."
 nf_vegas.4.a:0 "I chose Slither Kin: nomads who dealt in darker things."
 nf_vegas.4.b:0 "The Fiends were cunning and cruel like true mobsters."

 nf_vegas.5.t:0 "Reopening The Tops"
 nf_vegas.5.d:0 "The Tops was the casino for the middle-class man, offering simple luxuries and exclusive entertainment. To recapture that feeling I require a group of loyal wastelanders who know how to make others feel welcome."
 nf_vegas.5.a:0 "The Boot Riders had undergone a coup and were hungry for power."
 nf_vegas.5.b:0 "I learned of a gang called the Kings - fine hosts for The Tops."

 nf_vegas.6.t:0 "Reopening Ultra-Luxe"
 nf_vegas.6.d:0 "Tucked away into the far corner of the strip is the Ultra-Luxe, a beacon of prewar luxury which served only the highest class of clientele. Vegas welcomes all to empty their pockets, and a down trodden group attempting to cover up past misdeeds would be the perfect hosts."
 nf_vegas.6.a:0 "The downtrodden former cannibals of Vegas will make perfect hosts."
 nf_vegas.6.b:0 "The Great Khans lost everything - I will give it all back."

 nf_vegas.7.t:0 "Expansion: Inwards or Outwards?"
 nf_vegas.7.d:0 "My New Vegas was slowly coming together despite my early awakening, but decisions remained. I could either focus my attention on creating a rich, inner Vegas, and a poor "Freeside": or I could attempt to include all of Vegas into my grand vision."
 nf_vegas.7.a:0 "Inner Vegas was my priority, it was predicted to make the most profit."
 nf_vegas.7.b:0 "Improving Outer Vegas would bolster public support."

 nf_vegas.8.t:0 "Mojave Alliance"
 nf_vegas.8.d:0 "New Vegas has proposed an alliance with us for the betterment of the wasteland. Supposedly the leader of one of the casino families, the King, hopes to use our technology to help the people of the wasteland. They hope an alliance would further both our ambitions."
 nf_vegas.8.a:0 "Technology exists to help people."
 nf_vegas.8.b:0 "The Brotherhood stands alone."

 nf_vegas.9.t:0 "The Fate of Vault 21"
 nf_vegas.9.d:0 "Vault 21 was a prewar experiment set up by Vault Tec to observe how a society based around gambling would function in isolation. Surprisingly, unlike numerous horror stories found in the wasteland, this Vault got by without complications. Due to its good condition and living inhabitants there are two options for what can be done with the Vault. It could be stripped of all its useful resources and tech, or it could be converted into a large casino and hotel of its own."
 nf_vegas.9.a:0 "Convert it."
 nf_vegas.9.b:0 "Strip it."

 nf_vegas.10.t:0 "Victor says Howdy"
 nf_vegas.10.d:0 "With the assistance of the Followers of the Apocalypse, the Kings were able to capture and disable a securitron known as Victor. Preventing his personality from jumping was crucial, and after preventing the securitron from releasing him, the Followers used the forty seconds they had to good effect. Victor was cloaked from the network and reprogrammed slightly to remove his loyalty to the House - instead of making him loyal to the King and his ambitions."
 nf_vegas.10.a:0 "You serve the people now, General Victor."

 nf_vegas.11.t:0 "Enlist the Khans"
 nf_vegas.11.d:0 "Recruiting bodyguards from within the Chairmen would draw too much suspicion, and Benny knew that - that was why he enlisted the help of the Khans instead. Although well known in the Vegas area, the Khans had never been particularly important. "
 nf_vegas.11.a:0 "Nobody will notice some missing Khans."
 nf_vegas.11.b:0 "Ultra-Luxe guards? Yes please."

 nf_vegas.12.t:0 "Enlist the Chairmen"
 nf_vegas.12.d:0 "Despite the fact that recruiting from the Chairmen would draw suspicion, Benny felt like the only people he could trust were his former tribesmen. They'd been there to watch Benny murder Bingo and claim rulership, and they would be there to watch him do the same to house."
 nf_vegas.12.a:0 "The Chairmen can get the job done."

 nf_vegas.13.t:0 "Ain't That a Kick in the Head"
 nf_vegas.13.d:0 "Yes Man gave Benny all the information he needed: the courier would pass through Goodsprings on their way to Vegas. They waited for their quarry impatiently—eager to get the deed over with—until they finally arrived. It wasn't a fancy affair, the courier was jumped, tied up, and dug a shallow grave while they were still breathing. Maybe some of the men with Benny had an issue with his methods, or maybe they didn't - only the courier, Benny, and his men will ever know.\"Time to cash out\", Benny said as he dropped his cigarette, turning to face his victim. He slipped his hand inside his suit pocket, removing the platinum chip and flashing it to the courier. \"You've made your last delivery kid\" Concealing the chip back inside his suit, he removed an engraved pistol in its place. \"Sorry you got twisted up in this scene.\" He stared the courier in the eyes as he spoke, his victim distracted by the weapon at his side. \"From where you're kneeling it must seem like an 18-carat run of bad luck.\" He raised his pistol up at the courier's forehead.\"Truth is...\""
 nf_vegas.13.a:0 "\"...The game was rigged from the start.\""

 nf_vegas.14.t:0 "New Vegas Lights"

 nf_vegas.15.t:0 "Gunfire in the streets of Vegas"
 nf_vegas.15.d:0 "The time has come for the people of New Vegas to rise up against Mr. House and his regime. Wastelanders should be free to determine their own fates, without the meddling influence of an autocrat far removed from the people he rules over. The future of New Vegas is a Vegas where the average man can make something of himself, and not fear that he's a pawn in a megalomaniac's scheme. This isn't just a war for the future of New Vegas, but of the Mojave as a whole - our victory will show the Bull and the Bear that the people of the wasteland cannot be ignored!"
 nf_vegas.15.a:0 "The House is falling down!"

 nf_vegas.16.t:0 "Expedient Delivery"
 nf_vegas.16.d:0 "Finally, after thousands of caps spent, I have located the Platinum Chip. However, despite my expectation of an expedient delivery, my courier was stopped by the Brotherhood on their way out of San-Francisco. I don't have much control in the region, and the longer the courier stays in Brotherhood hands, the more likely they are to discover the chip's true nature."
 nf_vegas.16.a:0 "They're too stupid to discover it. I'll wait."
 nf_vegas.16.b:0 "Those morons will look the other way if I offer them something."

 nf_vegas.17.t:0 "Securitron Vault"
 nf_vegas.17.d:0 "Sleeping beneath the earth across from Hoover Dam, in a facility unlike any other, my army of Securitrons await their activation signal - slumbering beneath and old world weather monitoring station. With the platinum chip I can upgrade them all, activate them, and instruct the facility to begin constructing more securitrons. All I need to do is deliver the chip to the vault physically, and the automated processes will do the rest."
 nf_vegas.17.a:0 "One of my henchmen can go in disguise."
 nf_vegas.17.b:0 "I'll send a task force in and cause a distraction."

 nf_vegas.18.t:0 "Reconstructing Greatness"
 nf_vegas.18.d:0 "Within that old shell, House Resort, there is a framed picture of me in years gone by. Although I do not lament my actions leading up to this point, I do regret never knowing if the prototype in that portrait was ever finished. Its final form rests in D.C. and I will likely never see it again. But what if I could recreate my prototype? Could I reconstruct greatness?"
 nf_vegas.18.a:0 "I can do it in a year."
 nf_vegas.18.b:0 "It'll take me two years."

 nf_vegas.19.t:0 "Delayed Delivery"
 nf_vegas.19.d:0 "During a meeting with my right hand man, I was interrupted by a notification from one of my securitrons. That damned courier had finally found their way to me. Sending my men to see to the fool, they walked away with half of what they'd been promised - and I received my precious platinum chip."
 nf_vegas.19.a:0 "Finally! Now, to work..."

 nf_vegas.20.t:0 "New Vegas Makes an Offer"
 nf_vegas.20.d:0 "In the early hours of the morning, a RobCo robot unknown to us approached an outpost and demanded to speak to a 'superior'. Humouring the machine, a paladin spoke to it and received a proposition - release the courier we detained in Sunnyvale, and in return its master will provide us with advanced technology from the ruins of Vegas."
 nf_vegas.20.a:0 "The robot is dangerous; kill it. Question the courier."
 nf_vegas.20.b:0 "Advanced tech from Nevada? The bumpkin can go free."

 nf_vegas.21.t:0 "Desert Paladins"
 nf_vegas.21.d:0 "Our allies in New Vegas have proposed a joint war against the raider scum that inhabits the land. In return for promising to protect the passages into the Mojave, New Vegas will support us in a battle to secure the Southern Mojave for the Brotherhood once and for all."
 nf_vegas.21.a:0 "The Mojave is as good as ours."

 nf_vegas.22.t:0 "Vegas Prime"
 nf_vegas.22.d:0 "Without the resources at my disposal before the war it was incredibly difficult to finish my robot. Not only did I have to plan ahead to secure resources, I had to rely on wastelanders to do a large majority of the simple work for me. Everything could have easily gone wrong - but it didn't. Instead, today New Vegas watches as its protector strides across the horizon - Vegas Prime is fully operational."
 nf_vegas.22.a:0 "Finally it's ready."

 nf_vegas.23.t:0 "The King's Infiltration"
 nf_vegas.23.d:0 "The King wasn't an immediately obvious choice, but his time cultivating a loyal following made him an excellent speaker. However, despite being in full legionary kit, I worry that the King will stand out as an unusually conscious legionary. He can slip into the vault easily, but whether or not he can fool the legion remains to be seen."
 nf_vegas.23.a:0 "Now I must wait."

 nf_vegas.24.t:0 "Benny's Infiltration"
 nf_vegas.24.d:0 "I sent Benny to infiltrate the Legion's camp across from the Dam. It was easy enough to find a uniform for him; dead Legionaries are ubiquitous. Benny's skills of persuasion made slipping into the camp easy enough, but whether or not he would manage to enter the vault remained to be seen."
 nf_vegas.24.a:0 "Now I must wait."

 nf_vegas.25.t:0 "Firefight on Fortification Hill"
 nf_vegas.25.d:0 "I devised a simple plan to ensure that the Vault would come under my control once more: a securitron assault supported by mercenaries given quarter pay beforehand, and promised the next three quarters upon a successful return. All that remained was to decide how many securitrons I would send for the assault. A larger force guaranteed success, but it also guaranteed heavy losses and killings in retaliation. How much was I willing to bargain?"
 nf_vegas.25.a:0 "Full assault - spare northing."
 nf_vegas.25.b:0 "I'll send a few divisions for the assault."
 nf_vegas.25.c:0 "Actually, do I need the securitron diversion...?"

 nf_vegas.26.t:0 "Securitron Army"
 nf_vegas.26.d:0 "Securitrons rolled over the concrete of the Dam, monitors illuminating the night as they stared up at the Fort looming above. Firing at the few legionaries found outside the gates, they set about tearing down the defences to allow themselves in. Already large portions of the camp had roused from their slumber—distant battle cries made this apparent—and reinforcements were pouring down to the breach. Despite this, the small task force of well armed mercs that House had hired to storm the weather station managed to slip through the hellish battle. The few that made it inside faced even worse opponents, and the only man to make it through the hail of sentry bot gunfire inserted the chip as asked; spending his dying moments slumped against a wall, watching the securitrons being assembled and thinking of the promised payment as his blood ran cold."
 nf_vegas.26.a:0 "My army is ready; now it's time for true progress."

 nf_vegas.27.t:0 "The Vault Burns!"
 nf_vegas.27.d:0 "I put too little stock in how quickly the Legion would realise my plan. Mere moments after my chosen man activated the Vault, the Legion stormed the elevator as they exited and attempted to kill them. I'm unsure of how exactly they made it out alive, but they must've slipped out during the confusion as the tribals rushed to enter the secure area. My defences were incapable of defending against waves of legionaries, and before long, the Vault was burning. "
 nf_vegas.27.a:0 "Savages! How dare they destroy the Vault."

 nf_vegas.46.a:0 "The White Glove Society Society will do!"

 nf_vegas.47.t:0 "Benny's Army"
 nf_vegas.47.d:0 "Mr. House never spoke about the Vault directly, he kept his cards close to his chest and revealed as little as possible. Only with Yes Man's assistance was Benny able to uncover the truth behind the Platinum Chip - the reason he killed the courier for it. Now all the work that went into betraying House would come to fruition: Benny would get his army."
 nf_vegas.47.a:0 "Time to grease some palms"

 nf_vegas.48.t:0 "Foul Business"
 nf_vegas.48.d:0 "Caesar's Legion is widely regarded as one of the safest and most profitable parts of the wasteland to trade in. Caravans often make their way throughout Arizona, New Mexico, and Colorado completely free of raider interference. As such many traders don't even bring bodyguards - knowing that the Legion itself guarantees their safety via its existence. The only caveat in this enticing business deal is that the Legion doesn't allow the sale of drugs or advanced medicine in their land, among other things. This has made them unpopular with many traders in the Mojave, but today signifies the first major trade deal signed off by the three families. A large caravan comprising of traders and numerous bodyguards will stop off at the Fort briefly before continuing on their way through the Legion. The pretence for the guards is that the caravan plans to eventually leave Legion lands, but the truth is much more sinister..."
 nf_vegas.48.a:0 "Ever seen a 12.7 SMG, Legionary?"

 nf_vegas.49.t:0 "Trojan Horse"
 nf_vegas.49.d:0 "The Fort erupted into chaos as the bodyguards and caravanners pulled their guns on the legionaries. The recruits that had been assigned to keep an eye on the caravan were torn to shreds in mere moments, the well armed group mowing down the men around them in a spray of blood and gore. The setting sun cast a ghastly orange shade across the scene as reinforcements appeared across the ridge, the spilled blood filling their tribal veins with a savagery few live through. As the ranks began to fill out with decanus and centurions, the caravanners looked to Benny for advice - only to find him missing. Perhaps one or two glimpsed his figure at the top of the hill, briefly looking down at them, before it slithered over the ridge and into the camp proper. His promise of a small legion force had been a lie, his declaration that these cast-offs would be allowed back into the families was hollow. Distant machinery screamed to life, an army mobilised beneath the Legion's feet, and Benny was already halfway across the Dam. Pulling out his lighter, the snake had a celebratory smoke as he listened to the sound of gunfire slowly dwindle to silence."
 nf_vegas.49.a:0 "Dead nobodies face down in the dirt."

 nf_vegas.50.t:0 "The King Succeeds!"
 nf_vegas.50.d:0 "The King and his men grew up in the ruins of New Vegas, already having seen and sacrificed much before my return to the world stage. His history as a fighter and overwhelming charisma lead me to believe he'd be able to infiltrate the Legion and talk his way to the weather station with ease. My only concern was whether or not he'd be capable of withstanding the scenes of slavery, human rights violations, and brutality from within the Legion's beating heart. It seems that my assumptions were entirely correct. When the King reported his success to me, he mentioned striking out at a legionary on his way to the station. When I asked him to clarify, he told me that he couldn't stand the sight of this man torturing a slave, and had lashed out at him in a fit of sudden anger. Thankfully his emotions worked in his favour; nearby soldiers assumed someone had merely angered a decanus. Not wanting to be subject to his wrath next they left him alone on his ascent to the weather station. Although it was no doubt very difficult for him to leave those slaves behind as he exited the camp and returned, he performed as I asked, and for that has gained my respect."
 nf_vegas.50.a:0 "My army is ready; now it's time for true progress."

 nf_vegas.51.t:0 "The Chairmen Succeed!"
 nf_vegas.51.d:0 "I'd never been overly keen of Benny. He was capable, smart, and knew how to improvise - but he had ambition. Like a snake in the grass, if you turned your back on him you'd regret it once he sunk his fangs in. This was why I'd been hesitant to send him to the Legion. I fearful that his ambition would get the better of him; or worse his pride. However, Benny had grown up as a nomadic tribal, and while the Legion might be alien to him its soldiers weren't. By his account, he effortlessly slipped his way through the numerous areas of the Fort through both persuasion and stealth. Arriving at the weather station he took out the guards and entered the Vault. It wasn't long before he was on the home stretch, removing his trashy garb in favour of something more suited to his tastes. While I might not fully trust Benny as a person - I can trust his results."

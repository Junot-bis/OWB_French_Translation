  ncn_idea_church_education: "Church Schools"
  ncn_idea_church_education_desc: "At a minimum, all members of the Church of God must receive a basic education. Strangely enough, having an educated congregation really helps our research capabilities."
  ncn_idea_religious_immigrants: "Religious Immigrants"
  ncn_idea_religious_immigrants_desc: "Every week, almost without fail, we receive a slow trickle of immigrants come to the Holy Land to be close to God. Their numbers are very helpful."

  ncn_idea_utah_caravan_profits: "Profits from the Utah Caravans"
  ncn_idea_utah_caravan_profits_desc: "From humble beginnings, the riches of the Utah caravan trade have brought New Canaan wealth and power. By providing safe passage, expert navigation and rest stops to caravans that traverse our borders, we have attracted a huge number of caravans from across the wastelands, bringing exotic goods that we can sell on for a good price."
  ncn_idea_utah_caravan_profiteering: "Profiteering the Utah Caravan Trade"
  ncn_idea_utah_caravan_profiteering_desc: "From humble beginnings, the riches of the Utah caravan trade have brought New Canaan wealth and power. By providing safe passage, expert navigation and rest stops for a price to caravans that traverse our borders, we have attracted a huge number of caravans from across the wastelands. The caps they pay us in exchange for our services does go far..."
  ncn_idea_rapid_mobalisation: "Rapid Mobilisation"
  ncn_idea_rapid_mobalisation_desc: "The [WHT.GetName] threat is growing, and we are woefully unprepared for it. Without any real army, we stand little chance against the tribal hoards the [WHT.GetName] can field. We need to train our own units: and fast."
  ncn_idea_holy_flames_quenched: "Holy Flames Quenched"
  ncn_idea_holy_flames_quenched_desc: "Whilst the Canaanites have never been great war-makers, our defeat at the hands of the [WHT.GetName] has completely crushed any militarist disposition that trickled through the congregation. Nobody has any stomach for war: even Joshua has his qualms."
  ncn_idea_embers_of_a_holy_war: "Embers of the Holy Flame"
  ncn_idea_embers_of_a_holy_war_desc: "From the ashes, Canaan will rise. Hope lives amongst the congregation, in a hushed whisper or silent prayer: a hope that one day the Children of God may again reclaim their home."
  ncn_idea_gods_burning_flame: "God's Burning Flame"
  ncn_idea_gods_burning_flame_desc: "We can't expect God to do all the work: we must be God's earthly flame, cleansing the wastelands of the heathens that plague our homeland. One day we shall return."
  ncn_idea_theological_confusion: "Theological Confusion"
  ncn_idea_theological_confusion_desc: "Where is God? Why has he forsaken us? Is this punishment for the errors in our ways? These are all legitimate questions amongst the congregation, and they don't trust the answers the existing clergy are giving them."
  ncn_idea_religious_stabilization: "Religious Stabilisation"
  ncn_idea_religious_stabilization_desc: "With the help of Daniel's theological guidance, the surviving congregation of Canaan are beginning to see the light once more. Their doubts in God have been soothed, but many questions remain..."
  ncn_idea_divine_guidance_restored: "Divine Guidance Restored"
  ncn_idea_divine_guidance_restored_desc: "Daniel is our guiding light in the darkness. His quiet words and kind temperament have ensured the congregation remains on the right path, and has brought us all closer to God. Truly, he is the new living profit."
  ncn_idea_destroyed_economy: "Destroyed Economy"
  ncn_idea_destroyed_economy_desc: "When we were forced to flee New Canaan, we grabbed all we could. Our new home has little, and we've been forced to live from what we've brought: there's little in the way of production here. Still, we must rebuild."
  ncn_idea_self_sufficient_economy: "Self-sufficient Economy"
  ncn_idea_self_sufficient_economy_desc: "Whilst we're not thriving by any stretch of the imagination, we have established sufficient workshops and secured enough workshops to keep ourselves alive in our new home."
  ncn_idea_retooled_economy: "Retooled Economy"
  ncn_idea_retooled_economy_desc: "We'll never recover our economic might in our new home, but we don't need to. Our time in the wastelands has changed our industrial philosophy forever: teaching us to be resourceful and adaptive."
  ncn_idea_rampant_corruption: "Rampant Corruption"
  ncn_idea_rampant_corruption_desc: "A combination of our past decadence and our victories against the White Legs have meant that corruption is rampant within our society. A few caps in the right hands can land you almost anything, be it spiritual or material. The corruption was tolerable during the war, but is now beginning to bite..."
  ncn_idea_widespread_bribery: "Widespread Bribery"
  ncn_idea_widespread_bribery_desc: "Whilst the worst excesses of corruption have now been crushed, bribery remains a large problem within both the clergy and the army. The problem is improving, but far too slowly without intervention."
  ncn_idea_monetary_apathy: "Monetary Apathy"
  ncn_idea_monetary_apathy_desc: "Thanks to the constant preaching of Daniel, the congregation of New Canaan have become widely apathetic to money. Caps no longer excite them so, and as a result corruption and bribery has gradually subsided into nothingness. Not caring about money brings some other issues, however."
  ncn_idea_disrupted_economy: "Shattered Economy"
  ncn_idea_disrupted_economy_desc: "The war with the White Legs has shattered our economy into pieces. Every workshop was straining to deliver the demands of war, and now they seem unable to do much but produce weapons of war. The economy will take work to recover its past efficiency."
  ncn_idea_bandaged_economy: "Bandaged Economy"
  ncn_idea_bandaged_economy_desc: "Slowly and surely, we're repairing the wound the war with the White Legs has done to our economy. Through a series of temporary measures, we have managed to begin to stabilise the economy, allowing some growth."
  ncn_idea_economic_growth: "Economic Growth"
  ncn_idea_economic_growth_desc: "As a result of the extensive investment we've poured into the workshops across the country, the economy is slowly growing once more. People are beginning to build once more, and workshops seem to be more efficient then they ever were!"
  ncn_idea_warmongering_disposition: "Warmongering Disposition"
  ncn_idea_warmongering_disposition_desc: "Our conquest of the White Legs has gained us vast swathes of territory, and a sour relationship with the tribes we preach amongst. They worry that we may turn and conquer them after our successes to the south. Whilst we have no plans of doing this, the reputation remains."
  ncn_idea_rekindled_peacebuilding: "Rekindled Peacebuilding"
  ncn_idea_rekindled_peacebuilding_desc: "Through careful intervention on behalf of our missionaries, we have been able to begin to restore our peacebuilding reputation."

  ncn_idea_kingdom_of_god: "The Kingdom of God on Earth"
  ncn_idea_kingdom_of_god_desc: "By securing Utah for the faithful, we have established a safe state for all the children of God. Truly, New Canaan is God's Kingdom on Earth, and [NCN.GetLeader] is the King to lead us forwards."
  ncn_idea_old_world_blues: "Old World Blues"
  ncn_idea_old_world_blues_desc: "Through the persistence of Daniel and the power of his reforms, a hybrid version of the old Church has been restored to New Canaan. Taking the best parts of the pre-war Church and combining it with our wasteland experience has made a Church for all people."
  ncn_idea_legal_drug_shipments: "Legal Drug Shipments"
  ncn_idea_legal_drug_shipments_desc: "Whilst it would never be palatable to the congregation to legalise drugs themselves, if drugs are kept in sealed containers there's surely no harm in them passing through our borders. The trade brings good money, after all..."
  # Dynamic Modifiers
  ncn_threat_dynamic_modifier: "The White Legs Threat"
  ncn_threat_dynamic_modifier_desc: "The White Legs are on the horizon, and their every move scares the people of New Canaan a little more. In time, the Canaanites may even be inspired into action. Will it be too little too late, though..."
  ncn_decadence_dynamic_modifier: "Decadence's Clutches"
  ncn_decadence_dynamic_modifier_desc: "Slowly but surely, the Church has been taken over by caps and dirty secrets. Congregations are extravagant, and the clergy are wearing ever more opulent clothing. In time, it may hurt..."
  ncn_medics_of_lord: "Medics of the Lord"
  ncn_educating_tribals: "Educating Tribals"
  ncn_going_to_school: "Canaanite Education"
  ncn_idea_the_invisible_hand: "The Invisible Hand"
  ncn_idea_the_invisible_hand_desc: "An invisible hand is playing with our economy, driving us to export more and more to make our masters in New Canaan richer."

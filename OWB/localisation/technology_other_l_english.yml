  medic_methods: "Amputation"
  medic_methods_desc: "Amputation is the removal of a limb by trauma, medical illness, or surgery. As a surgical measure, it is used to control pain or a disease process in the affected limb, such as malignancy or gangrene. In some cases, it is carried out on individuals as a preventative surgery for such problems."
  medic_methods_1: "Disinfection"
  medic_methods_1_desc: "Disinfectants are antimicrobial agents that are applied to the surface of non-living objects to destroy microorganisms that are living on the objects. Disinfection does not necessarily kill all microorganisms, especially resistant bacterial spores; it is less effective than sterilization, which is an extreme physical and/or chemical process that kills all types of life."
  medic_methods_2: "Triage"
  medic_methods_2_desc: "Triage is the process of determining the priority of patients' treatments based on the severity of their condition. This rations patient treatment efficiently when resources are insufficient for all to be treated immediately. The term comes from the French verb trier, meaning to separate, sift or select. Triage may result in determining the order and priority of emergency treatment, the order and priority of emergency transport, or the transport destination for the patient. "

  medic_methods_4_desc: "A hospital is a health care institution providing patient treatment with specialized medical and nursing staff and medical equipment."
  medic_methods_5: "Radiography"
  medic_methods_5_desc: "Radiography is an imaging technique using X-rays to view the internal structure of an object. To create the image, a beam of X-rays, a form of electromagnetic radiation, are produced by an X-ray generator and are projected toward the object. A certain amount of X-ray is absorbed by the object, dependent on its density and composition. The X-rays that pass through the object are captured behind the object by a detector (either photographic film or a digital detector). The generation of flat two dimensional images by this technique is called projectional radiography."
  medic_methods_6: "Auto-Docs"
  medic_methods_6_desc: "An Auto-Doc (abbreviation of "Automatic Doctor") is a miracle of pre-War medical technology - a device capable of performing even the most complex medical procedures without qualified medical personnel. Even for a talented physician, these are invaluable aids."

  implant_bionic_eye: "Bionic Eye"
  implant_bionic_eye_desc: "In the effort to improve combat abilities of soldiers by cybernetically enhancing their bodies, Bionic Eyes were one of the first targets of research. As such, they come in multiple variations with different features, ranging from improved night vision to advanced heat or electro-magnetic vision modes."
  implant_razor_nails: "Razor Nails"
  implant_razor_nails_desc: "Developed for spies and assassins, Razor Nails turn the human hand into a lethal weapon. To avoid detection or self-inflicted injuries, the blades stay retracted under the fingernails until activated. The most effective attack locations are the major arteries."
  implant_monocyte_breeder: "PHOENIX Monocyte Breeder"
  implant_monocyte_breeder_desc: "Developed by Med-Tek, the PHOENIX Monocyte Breeder greatly enhances the healing capabilities of the human body. Due to rapid cell regeneration, recovery after even the most severe injuries is reduced to several days instead of weeks or months."
  implant_kinetic_accelerator: "Kinetic Accelerator"
  implant_kinetic_accelerator_desc: "Consisting of a mechanical and a neurological control component, the Kinetic Accelerator can be used to speed up movement of various body parts.

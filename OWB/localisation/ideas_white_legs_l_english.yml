These false lies from the New Canaanites ignore that we respect our women as equals, that our leaders are chosen through merit, and that the New Canaanites, who steal from caravans and call it taxes, also take what they want.  Fools who view us this way never stop to ask what we want.  \n\nThat said, we simply aren't as good at the magic of paper as the New Canaanites or Californians. We'll have to fix that."

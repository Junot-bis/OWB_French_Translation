 TOC_electric:9 "Theodore Price"
 TOC_electric_desc:9 " Before the war, Price worked for the Northwest Commonwealth Electrical Concern. Their main goal was to fuel the infrastructure hub linking the United States and the recently annexed Canada. After the war, most of the plants were nothing more than a relic of the Old World, no fossil fuels left to burn in the rampant wastes. A single nuclear plant in Electric City operated, and Price aims to keep it running. Being almost as old as he was and still working to keep the lights on, he views the plant as a kindred spirit of sorts; A tether to a past that can't be broken just yet. "
 TOC_quartermaster:9 "Joshua Nevin"
 TOC_quartermaster_desc:9 "The Wasteland seems to have it out for Ghouls. Moving down from the hellscape of Alaska, Nevin was looking for a better life without persecution. What he found was more of the same, another place where his skin was a death warrant to some people. Arming himself and any other ghouls to the teeth, he is determined to spite all the bigots in Coure d'Alene simply by surviving."
 ROT_reformer:9 "Gabrielle Keen"
 ROT_reformer_desc:9 "Hatred alone cannot be your only food. With the Rotpurgers getting ready to take Spokane from the mutants, many wonder what their next move will be when the snow has settled. Gabrielle Keen views it as the first step in reclaiming a portion of the old world. The sins of their forefathers will never be washed away, but the world doesn't need to be stained in ash and shame forever."

 TCA_paramilitary:9 "Vaniah Grant"
 TCA_paramilitary_desc:9 "The Cause is more than just a group of idealists squatting in ruins. With the might and prowess of former brotherhood members along with the funding and influence of the Wardens, they hope to be more than just a reactionary force to the Immortal's terrible plans for the Wasteland."
 TCA_friend:9 "Amos Tilley"
 TOC_trapper:9 "Killian Nelson"
 TOC_trapper_desc:9 "The cold will strip the bravery off even the fiercest of men. Anything to insulate against the freezing wind is necessary to survive. To this end, trappers like Killian Nelson hunt the beasts of the brutal tundra to hold death at bay for just a bit longer."

 TCA_helper:9 "Caleb Rose"
 TCA_helper_desc:9 "Things don't have to be this race to see who can be the most brutal or cunning. The cooperation of the Wardens and Brotherhood refugees could be a turning point for the Northwest if they can survive the coming storm. There can be no bartering with the wolves who view the innocents of the world as sheep."
 ROT_inquisitor:9 "Inquisitor Manoah"
 ROT_bigot:9 "Jax Campbell"
 ROT_bigot_desc:9 "\"I'm not going to pretend that violence is enjoyable. Killing animals shouldn't be seen as fun, but it needs to be done to keep order and trim the weeds.\" "

 # Localisation Tech Doctrine Automated Warfare
 automated_warfare:0 "Automated Warfare"
 automated_warfare_desc:0 "Automated Warfare focuses on sending machines, not men, at the enemy. Men are squishy, robots are not.\n\n"
 combat_protocols:0 "Human Targeting Firmware"
 combat_protocols_desc:0 "While much sturdier in combat than their human counterparts, robots do not possess the inate ability to differenciate between friend and foe easily. The inclusion of advanced targeting firmware will make our robots even deadlier.\n\n"
 advanced_combat_protocols:0 "Dynamic Tactics Integration"
 advanced_combat_protocols_desc:0 "Robots capable of assaulting enemy positions effectively are good—but not good enough. Implementing squad tactics into their movements and making them work in conjunction with other forces is the next step.\n\n"
 automated_distribution:0 "Automated Distribution"
 automated_distribution_desc:0 "While normally difficult to maintain across vast distances, the use of robots as our supply chains ensures supplies always arrive on time.\n\n"
 rushed_production:0 "Rushed Production"
 rushed_production_desc:0 "It's essential for our units to reach the frontlines as quickly as possible. In order to keep our armies on the move we must sacrifice quality in return for faster construction speeds.\n\n"
 self_replicating_machinery:0 "Self Replicating Machinery"
 self_replicating_machinery_desc:0 "Simply producing robots in factories isn't good enough. Our forces should be capable of scavenging, repurposing enemy equipment, and tearing apart buildings for resources to create copies of themselves.\n\n"
 field_maintenance:0 "Field Maintenance"
 field_maintenance_desc:0 "It can be difficult to bring units back from the field for repairs during long campaigns. Rather than waiting, or allowing our units to continue the fight while damaged, we can give them the ability to repair eachother.\n\n"
 the_flesh_is_weak:0 "The Flesh is Weak"
 the_flesh_is_weak_desc:0 "Human combatants simply can't compare to robots in one-on-one engagements. Utilizing extensive internal scans of the human body will allow our robots to know exactly where to shoot for maximum injury.\n\n"
 refined_construction:0 "Refined Construction"
 refined_construction_desc:0 "Weapons like anti-materiel rifles and explosives make our units vulnerable. By incorporating studier materiels into our construction methods we can mitigate the effect of these deadly weapons.\n\n"
 combat_simulations:0 "Combat Simulations"
 combat_simulations_desc:0 "Having the upper hand in combat isn't enough. We need our victory to be unquestionable. Every piece of information, every variable, will be fed into our very own ZAX—we will know the outcome before the battle begins.\n\n"
 offensive_protocols_doctrine:0 "War Games"
 offensive_protocols_doctrine_desc:0 "Despite utilizing advanced targeting firmware, our robots are not as dynamic in battle as we need them to be. Rather than creating new firmware we can enable direct control of our forces via VR simulators. For our enemies, the only winning move is not to play.\n\n"
 iron_fist:0 "Human Commanders"
 iron_fist_desc:0 "Introducing humans into our machine network has resulted in increased combat effectiveness at the cost of self preservation. If we use our human pilots as commanders rather than just footsoldiers, we will be able to implement and execute much deadlier tactics mid battle.\n\n"
 age_of_the_machine:0 "Age of the Machine"
 age_of_the_machine_desc:0 "The need for human combatants is behind us. We are capable of producing and deploying vast robotic armies, whose commanders sit hundreds of miles away, piloting their units remotely. Our robots are the be-all and end-all of ground forces.\n\n"
 standardised_blueprints:0 "Standardised Blueprints"
 standardised_blueprints_desc:0 "It's not enough to have robots use the same components, every unit must be built identically and kept that way during maintenance. Standardisation allows for faster construction, faster repairs, and faster salvaging of broken units.\n\n"
 networked_ai:0 "Networked AI"
 networked_ai_desc:0 "Simple intelligence is easy to program, but fully autonomus AI is another matter entirely. We can give all of our robots an AI firmware upgrade, making them smarter, more autonomus, and even giving them true personalities. Over time these personalities might diverge, but their hivemind network should prevent rogue units.\n\n"
 internal_replicators:0 "Internal Replicators"
 internal_replicators_desc:0 "Building off of our standardised construction and autonomous units, we can give our robots the ability to make self repairs internally. This incredibly advanced technology makes them studier and less reliant on supply chains.\n\n"
 
 # Localisation Tech Doctrine Elite Forces
 elite_army:0 "Refined Warfare"
 elite_army_desc:0 "Limited manpower and expensive equipment costs necessitate careful action. Knowing which men to use, when to use them, and how to effectively retreat from battle is key to our success in war.\n\n"
 concentration_of_force:0 "Concentration of Force"
 concentration_of_force_desc:0 "Scarcity of resources and Men requires us to be sure of every offensive action. When attacking any enemy we cannot take them lightly. We must strike decisively, in a combined effort, and leave no room for survival.\n\n"
 speed_of_movement:0 "Rapid Deployment"
 speed_of_movement_desc:0 "Creating a small "Rapid Deployment Force" isn't good enough—our entire army must function like one. All of our forces will be drilled until they are the best of the best, capable of packing up, relocating, and redeploying at a moment's notice.\n\n"
 intergrated_support_doctrine:0 "Integrated Support"
 intergrated_support_doctrine_desc:0 "Integration of support forces with frontline units will allow for more effective use of their equipment in battle, enabling tactics that require much greater cooperation between numerous squads.\n\n"
 adaptive_chain_of_command:0 "Adaptive Chain of Command"
 adaptive_chain_of_command_desc:0 "Despite our best efforts, sometimes people die. If a commander falls in the field their squad should be capable of picking up the pieces immediately, quickly choosing a replacement from amongst themselves for a battlefield promotion.\n\n"
 walking_fire:0 "Marching Fire"
 walking_fire_desc:0 "Not only should our forces be capable of rapid deployment, but also of firing on the move. Machinegunners need to be capable of quickly moving from firing position to firing postion as the main infantry force advances.\n\n"
 hit_and_run:0 "Hit-and-Run"
 hit_and_run_desc:0 "We don't always have the manpower for large scale assaults—or even small assaults against vast enemies—so instead we must opt for a different method of attack. Moving quickly to where the enemy is weakest, striking hard, and quickly retreating before they can punish our advance.\n\n"
 walking_tanks:0 "Walking Tanks"
 walking_tanks_desc:0 "Power armour was one of the greatest military innovations produced before the Great War; and arguably serves its purpose even better in the post apocalypse. However, the trade-off for its combat prowess is the lengthy training time required to use it.\n\n"
 non_discriminatory_targeting:0 "Non-Discriminatory Targeting"
 non_discriminatory_targeting_desc:0 "Our enemies are bogged down by their pathetic self imposed "morality," and this makes them vulnerable. No man is safe, no settlement shall remain unmolested. In our mission to purge the wasteland of its scum we will do anything and everything to disrupt and ultimately destroy our enemies.\n\n"
 airborne_assaults:0 "Airborne Assaults"
 airborne_assaults_desc:0 "Wastelanders have forgotten the fear of the skies, their dullard lives have never been threatened than anything more than pitiful mutant scum. Every wastelander will learn to fear the unmistakable sound of a vertibird overheard—for it foretells the doom of any who happen upon the soliders it deploys.\n\n"
 scorched_earth:0 "Scorched Earth"
 scorched_earth_desc:0 "What more do the scum of the wasteland have than their tiny settlements? We have no need for such things, they are worthless to us, and therefore they do not need to exist. We will tear down their settlements, burn down their homes, and salt the earth they so feedbly attempted to cultivate.\n\n"
 shock_and_awe_doctrine:0 "Shock and Awe"
 shock_and_awe_doctrine_desc:0 "Remorse is not a word in our vocabulary, and neither is mercy. Our troops don't have the time to check every silhouette—if it moves it dies. Our enemies cannot hope to defend themselves when the floors of their pathetic "outposts" are slick with the blood of their wives and children.\n\n"
 recon_in_depth:0 "Recon Infiltration"
 recon_in_depth_desc:0 "It's not enough to simply patrol our own land. Our forces must spread out across the wasteland in search of any and all technology, to keep all potentially dangerous devices out of the hands of fools. Our massive sphere of influence will make gathering tactical information much easier.\n\n"
 warrior_code_doctrine:0 "Warrior Code"
 warrior_code_doctrine_desc:0 "We turned our back on the Old World because it turned its back on us. Science and technology went too far, the "geniuses" of the past never stopped to think "Is this too far?". It is our responsibility to ensure such monsterous science is never misused or recreated, and that it never harms humanity again.\n\n" 
 combined_arms_doctrine:0 "Combined Arms"
 combined_arms_doctrine_desc:0 "Power armour in of itself is not the be-all and end-all of ground combat. In fact, by itself, power armour can prove to be vulnerable. In order to counteract these issues, we should combine power armour and infantry more closely, creating mixed squads that make the best use of both forces.\n\n"
 brigades_of_steel:0 "Champions of Virtue"
 brigades_of_steel_desc:0 "Power armour is more than just a piece of equipment—it is a symbol. To our men in the field, serving alongside those in powered armour is a source of great comfort. They know that these men and women will stand and fight in the face of overwhelming odds to ensure their infantry counterparts can retreat safely.\n\n"
 
 # Localisation Tech Doctrine Grand Army
 grand_army:0 "Conventional Warfare"
 grand_army_desc:0 "We're fighting not to decimate a population, or to strike at our enemy for being different than us—we're fighting to survive. Warfare isn't a way of life, it's a consiquence of life, and we aim to make conflict as brief as possible.\n\n"
 grand_battle_plan_owb:0 "Battle Plans"
 grand_battle_plan_owb_desc:0 "Old World armies would plan out their offensives well ahead of time in order to ensure a more complete victory. As mere settlers and survivors the need to plan attacks was minimal, but with a growing army and nation we find ourselves reliant on the lessons of the Old World.\n\n"
 fortified_positions_doctrine:0 "Field Fortifications"
 fortified_positions_doctrine_desc:0 "Training our men in the design and construction of simple field fortifications will aid them during defensive operations, as well as increase overall organisation. This is due to the need for unit cohesion during construction.\n\n"
 grand_assault_doctrine:0 "Coordinated Assault"
 grand_assault_doctrine_desc:0 "With the foundation of prior training well established in our military, we can begin to combine these techniques to great effect. Large scale land assaults where multiple armies cooperate to achieve an objective are now possible, allowing us to strike our enemies much more effectively.\n\n"
 mechanized_offensive_doctrine:0 "Mechanised Forces"
 mechanized_offensive_doctrine_desc:0 "Motorised troops are the future of warfare. The Old World put them to great use in numerous engagements, and we can look to history in order to correctly apply these units in battle.\n\n"
 assault_concentration_doctrine:0 "Concentrated Assault"
 assault_concentration_doctrine_desc:0 "Utilising both armoured and infantry forces in conjunction will make our assaults much more effective, at the expense of our supply chain.\n\n"
 old_world_tactics:0 "Motorised Deployment"
 old_world_tactics_desc:0 "Even if the vast majority of our infantry doesn't make use of mechanised vehicles in combat, we should make extensive use of vehciles in order to move our units faster.\n\n"
 old_world_thunder:0 "Armoured Assault"
 old_world_thunder_desc:0 "Tanks are incredibly expensive to produce and restore but their combat effectiveness cannot be understated. They are true titans, capable of killing droves of men and other vehicles with ease. Integrating them into our assaults will make them much more potent.\n\n"
 old_world_lightning:0 "Rapid Motorised Deployment"
 old_world_lightning_desc:0 "Building off of our previous implementation of motorised deployment for our infantry, we can implement more robust schedules for our drivers to ensure that our units arrive to their desintations faster.\n\n"
 mechanized_onslaught:0 "Coordinated Onslaught"
 mechanized_onslaught_desc:0 "Our army has become a complex mechanised outfit thanks to our effort, and now we can finally ultilise all of this preparation. Massive assaults composed of mechanised infantry, breakthroughs spearheaded by tanks, and rapid reinforcement via the use of motorised redeployment.\n\n"
 hold_the_line:0 "Prepared Defense"
 hold_the_line_desc:0 "There is an art to the creation of cohesive defences. It's not enough to simply defend one area, our soldiers need to be capable of defending in depth and reacting to enemy advances.\n\n"
 concentration_of_firepower:0 "Anti-Armour Tactics"
 concentration_of_firepower_desc:0 "Infantry can accomplish many things, but the presence of armoured vehicles and power armour can distrupt operations significantly. Training our forces to effectively use anti-armour equipment will give them more of a fighting chance in the field.\n\n"
 new_world_tactics:0 "Wasteland Survivalism"
 new_world_tactics_desc:0 "Supply lines cannot always be established across dangerous terrain. Armies on the move always run into supply problems, due to shortages, misuse of supplies, and complications with wasteland wildlife. Teaching our men to use the environment around them will reduce the burden on our logistics.\n\n"
 send_in_the_next_wave:0 "Mercenary Conscription"
 send_in_the_next_wave_desc:0 "Losses can be difficult to replace during long engagements, so in order to fill gaps until new units arrive, we can hire mercenaries to serve alongside our men. This won't make our army any larger, rather it will enable us to reinforce our units quicker until proper reinforcements can arrive.\n\n"
 mass_conscription:0 "Civilian Draft"
 mass_conscription_desc:0 "Campaigns can last anywhere from weeks to years, and over time losses begin to pile up. Establishing a civilian draft would give us a much larger recruitment pool to work with—but it would come at the cost of lowered unit effectiveness.\n\n"
 ranger_infiltration:0 "Infiltration Tactics"
 ranger_infiltration_desc:0 "Infiltration of enemy controlled areas will allow us to gather reconnaissance, such as information on enemy positions, and supply lines. We can use this information, as well as the presence of allies in enemy territory, to attack with my greater effect.\n\n"
 
 # Localisation Tech Doctrine Terror Tactics
 terror_tactics:0 "Asymmetric Warfare"
 terror_tactics_desc:0 "To win we must be unpredictable. Our men are many and our industry is few, but this does not hinder us. If we want to dominate the wasteland we must put technology behind us. Lasers will not win the day: our numbers will.\n\n"
 pocket_defence_doctrine:0 "Foraging"
 pocket_defence_doctrine_desc:0 "Broc flower, barrel cactus fruit, mutfruit... the list goes on. The wasteland offers many fruits, berries, and leaves for our men to harvest. Scouts are expected to forage for food while ahead of the army, leading to greater chances of survival when cut off from the main force.\n\n"
 terror_tactics_actual:0 "Improvised Obstructions"
 terror_tactics_actual_desc:0 "Spiked barricades can be quickly and easily constructed before or during engagements, and set up to deter enemy formations from large assaults. While creating these barricades we will inevitably end up with leftover spikes, which our soldiers can modify into makeshift javelins.\n\n"
 decimato_doctrine:0 "Decimation"
 decimato_doctrine_desc:0 "Failure must be punished, but how can an army punish large groups of offenders? Decimation is the answer. Divide the men into groups of ten and force them to draw lots. Whichever man the lot falls to is executed by his nice peers for the failure of the whole.\n\n"
 ego_gloriam_nominis:0 "Wedge Formations"
 ego_gloriam_nominis_desc:0 "We can thin our lines and concentrate men in the middle, like a wedge, to smash through enemy lines. This tactic was used extensively by the ancient Roman Empire to great effect, and we can similarly put it to good use in the wasteland.\n\n"
 prae_timore_mortis:0 "Cannae Formations"
 prae_timore_mortis_desc:0 "Building off of our use of the wedge formation, we can also train our troops to utilise the cannae tactic. Strong outer formations with a weak centre left deliberately open to encourage the enemy to pile in and become enveloped.\n\n"
 exitum:0 "Cult of Personality"
 exitum_desc:0 "Our might draws many wastelanders to our ranks: like moths to the flame. Our rule is harsh but fair, and our brutality protects settlers from the horrors of the wasteland. If an enemy ever marches through our lands they will find themselves constantly harassed by our population.\n\n"
 invisibilia_mortem:0 "Strong Right Flank"
 invisibilia_mortem_desc:0 "Much like the wedge and cannae formations, the strong right flank is a tactic designed to overwhelm the enemy. Concentrating our forces on the right flank allows them to break the enemy's left flank, then they "roll up the line" and attack the enemy from the rear.\n\n"
 divide_et_vincet:0 "Military Engineering"
 divide_et_vincet_desc:0 "Roman Legions constructed their own fortifications on the move. Their camps were more akin to permanent settlements, fit with walls, trenches, watch towers, and so on. By adopting these methods our armies will be much harder to remove from occupied territory.\n\n"
 summa_bellum:0 "The Legion"
 summa_bellum_desc:0 "The Roman Legion was the pinnacle of military tactics in the ancient era. Legionaries were capable of reorganising their formation at a moments notice, with their commanders shouting orders in the middle of battle, instructing them to become one of many formations. We will become a true Legion: and nobody will be able to stop us.\n\n"
 
 tribal_wisdom_doctrine:0 "Wasteland Knowledge"
 tribal_wisdom_doctrine_desc:0 "Growing up under the unforgiving sun of the dead land makes our soldiers more keenly aware of their surroundings. The inate ability to recognise a safe place to rest, to know which paths to take, and to be able to traverse the wastes at great speed: we possess all of these qualities.\n\n"
 the_dog_barks:0 "Wasteland Intuition"
 the_dog_barks_desc:0 "Split second decision making is often the difference between life and death. For our soldiers who've grown up in the harsh sands of the wasteland, relying on intuition is second nature to them. Instinctively knowing when an enemy is approaching, or where to look for danger, gives us an edge on the battlefield.\n\n"
 the_wolf_pack:0 "The Gang"
 the_wolf_pack_desc:0 "If you're fighting alone you're dying alone. Everyone in the wasteland knows, from raiders to dirt licking tribals, that you need buddies to stay alive. Someone to watch your back, a gang of pals to help you clean out a place and polish off the loot. Sure it can get annoying being bossed around—but it's better than being dead.\n\n"
 the_mirelurk_pincer:0 "Animal Observation"
 the_mirelurk_pincer_desc:0 "Nature is scary. Wasteland creatures can kill a man faster than most weapons can, and they'll move onto the next guy faster than you can reload, too. We can learn from the deadly predators of the wasteland to make our armies much deadlier.\n\n"
 the_nightstalkers_bite:0 "Nightstalker Tactics"
 the_nightstalkers_bite_desc:0 "Capable of turning themselves invisible when they feel threatened, Nightstalkers are experts of stealth. Although we obviously can't turn invisible we can learn a lot from the way they stalk their prey, as well as their tendancy to fight in quick strikes rather than prolonged engagements.\n\n"
 the_cazadores_speed:0"Cazadore Venom"
 the_cazadores_speed_desc:0"Simple poisons aren't good enough anymore. If we truly want to harm our enemies inside and out from the first engagement, radscorpion poison won't do. Our men must hunt the fearsome cazadores, harvest their venom, and return to us. If nothing else the experience will teach them the importance of a speedy retreat.\n\n"
 the_deathclaws_might:0"Deathclaw Ferocity"
 the_deathclaws_might_desc:0"Feared throughout the continent for their ability to murder anything within seconds, the mighty deathclaw is the apex predator of the wasteland. Where did they come from? Nobody knows, but wherever deathclaws go death follows. We must become like them, a terrifying power that all living men fear.\n\n"

 # Electronics Localisation
 electronic_engineering:0 "Ohm´s Law"
 electronic_engineering_desc:0 "Ohm's law states that the current through a conductor between two points is directly proportional to the voltage across the two points. It is quintessential for anything remotely related to electricity."
 electronic_engineering_1:0 "Resistor"
 electronic_engineering_1_desc:0 "A resistor is a passive two-terminal electrical component that implements electrical resistance as a circuit element. In electronic circuits, resistors are used to reduce current flow, adjust signal levels, to divide voltages, bias active elements, and terminate transmission lines, among other uses. High-power resistors that can dissipate many watts of electrical power as heat, may be used as part of motor controls, in power distribution systems, or as test loads for generators."
 electronic_engineering_2:0 "Vaccum Tubes"
 electronic_engineering_2_desc:0 "A vacuum tube, an electron tube, is a device that controls electric current between electrodes in an evacuated container. Vacuum tubes mostly rely on thermionic emission of electrons from a hot filament or a heated cathode. This type is called a thermionic tube or thermionic valve. A phototube, however, achieves electron emission through the photoelectric effect. "
 electronic_engineering_3:0 "Simple Circuitry"
 electronic_engineering_3_desc:0 "An electronic circuit is composed of individual electronic components, such as resistors, vaccum tubes, capacitors, inductors and diodes, connected by conductive wires or traces through which electric current can flow."
 electronic_engineering_4:0 "Complicated Circuitry"
 electronic_engineering_4_desc:0 "The combination of components and wires allows various simple and complex operations to be performed: signals can be amplified, computations can be performed, and data can be moved from one place to another."
 electronic_engineering_5:0 "Miniaturized Circuitry"
 electronic_engineering_5_desc:0 "Miniaturization is the trend to manufacture ever smaller mechanical, optical and electronic products and devices. With the ability to store ever more hardware power in less and less space have computers drastically reduced in scale."

 electronic_engineering_6_desc:0 "The Pip-Boy 2000 displays information in bright green on its black 5" x 3" screen, can record sound and video footage for later playback, and uses a simple yet elegant form of sonar and satellite tracking where satellite coverage is available to map out areas where its user travels. Though input is slow, a user can also hand-enter and edit text messages on the Pip-Boy 2000. Also available in gold, white and blue."
 electronic_engineering_7:0 "ZAX Technology"
 electronic_engineering_7_desc:0 "Developed by Vault-Tec, Zax is a series of advanced supercomputers capable of learning, independent thought and creativity, with added error insertion to improve its variance in experience and learning capability. ZAX 1.0, the original prototype, went online in 2054. Initially a prototype of some of the systems designed to govern the Vaults, it was given to the federal government to help the Department of Energy collect resource data. Within a year, it was taken by the American military for plague and tactical research; one version of the machine, ZAX 1.2, was constructed for the defense contractor West Tek."

To create the image, a beam of X-rays, a form of electromagnetic radiation, are produced by an X-ray generator and are projected toward the object. A certain amount of X-ray is absorbed by the object, dependent on its density and composition. The X-rays that pass through the object are captured behind the object by a detector (either photographic film or a digital detector). The generation of flat two dimensional images by this technique is called projectional radiography."

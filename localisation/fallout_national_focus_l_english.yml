 ces_fortify_the_dam: "Fortify The Dam"

 ces_scouring_the_strip: "Scourging The Strip"
 ces_scouring_the_strip_desc: "The Strip was once used by the NCR to improve morale by its soldiers. Such decadence and debauchery is uncharacteristic of a proper military force, so we will scourge the Strip, and use it to arm our soldiers."

 bos_glow_desc: "In 2134, after the formal formation of the Brotherhood of Steel, a splinter faction lead by Dennis Allen, who was among Maxson's original soldiers, requested permission to return to the West-Tek facility in search of technological artifacts. Understanding fully that this was the most dangerous mission ever presented to the council, he trusted his good reputation to garner him permission."

 bos_vipers: "The Vipers"
 bos_vipers_desc: "The War with the Vipers was a skirmish like any other, routine patrols engaging in small and one sided firefights with random raider gangs. But this time it was different, this time there were casualties. Maxson himself died hours after the engagement, writing in pain as radscorpion venom claimed him. This painful and horrific death lead to outrage among the Brotherhood of Steel."

 bos_navarro: "Navarro or Nothing"
 bos_navarro_desc: "Control of Navarro base was the singular grand reward for the Brotherhood following the battle of Navarro. The NCR has always rejected and loathed that we gained it in the following peace agreements, and will certainly seek to reclaim it. The word from the Elders is thus! Navarro or Nothing!"

 bos_citadel: "Citadel of Steel"
 bos_citadel_desc: "The Brotherhood of Steel has not been tested in combat like this in many long years, an open war against foes who have the capacity to finally defeat us. We must be a Citadel of Steel against the hordes of the NCR. Unbreakable and defiant."

 bos_newsteel: "New Steel"
 bos_newsteel_desc: "The sudden need to produce and repair power armor in-mass has lead to the discovery of unnecessary and redundant systems and features within the armor, the removal of which can rapidly expedite the process of construction."

 bos_ghouls: "Ghoul Recruitment"
 bos_ghouls_desc: "Although it is heavily protested, man within the Brotherhood feel that desperate times call for desperate measures. The NCR has alienated ghouls in uncountable numbers over the last few decades, many of whom would happily side with us, if only to stick it to the NCR once and for all."

 bos_victoryforge: "Forge of Victory"

 # Internal Restructuring sub-tree

 bos_restructure: "Internal Restructuring"
 bos_restructure_desc: "The Brotherhood of Steel has had trouble with manpower for decades, due in no small part to a general refusal to accept outside aid. However, it is becoming increasingly obvious that such things are unviable, and that we shall have to change as the wasteland changes."

 bos_outsiders: "Outsider Recruitment"
 bos_outsiders_desc: "The recruitment of outsiders, those loyal too and who have expressed interest in joining the Brotherhood of Steel, is the first and most step for our push for recruitment. Although they are resented by many outside of our organization, these outsides will help to flesh out the ranks."

 bos_wastelandconscripts: "Wasteland Conscription"
 bos_wastelandconscripts_desc: "Perviously, Wasteland Conscription has been something that only the most desperate of Elders consider, as demanding able bodied men and women from those townships that we defend is considered primitive and overtly tyrannical to most within the organization."

 bos_techreallocation: "Tech Reallocation"
 bos_techreallocation_desc: "Even the Brotherhood lacks perfect logistics, and vast quantities of technology are left to waste away in storehouses and bunkers. Rechecking the books and making sure that little is wasted will carry us far."

 bos_advancedcommunication: "Advanced Communication"
 bos_advancedcommunication_desc: "As strange as it sounds, most groups within the wasteland don't even attempt basic encryption on their files and valuable documents. The Brotherhood on the other hand, is constantly improving their firewalls and coding methods to be certain that only those who are meant to understand understand."

 bos_surfacetensions: "Surface Tensions"
 bos_surfacetensions_desc: "For decades, the Brotherhood of Steel has refuses to engage in outside activities, often leading the people of the wasteland out on a limb when it comes too protection in favor of more lucrative operations gathering technology. This has not only hurt our public image, but our moral as a force for good. It is time for the Brotherhood of Steel to again be proactive."

# Old Bonds sub-tree

 bos_oldbonds: "Old Bonds"
 bos_oldbonds_desc: "The Brotherhood and NCR have stood by each other in the past, if only because both are bastions of civilization in this harsh wasteland. Yet now, the NCR is threatened by a foe unlike any other, a horde of raiders and fiends so massive that even the might NCR buckles under the pressure. If California is to survive, we must act."

 bos_logistics: "Logistical Support"
 bos_logistics_desc: "The NCR take pride in their logistical support, gods know why. It's a mess, and they seem to lack all but the most basic of structuring. Simple advice and minor upgrades on their communication networks should make them a force to be reckoned with."

 bos_ncrforge: "NCR Forge"
 bos_ncrforge_desc: "Massive amounts of long hoarded wealth and technology are being channeled into the NCR's war effort, and their economy is buckling under the pressure. It has been suggested by several Elders that we go forth and reinforce the heart of the NCR's industry, Shady Sands, so that it might better stand against the tide."

 # Common Ground with Savages sub-tree

 bos_commonground: "Common Ground with Savages"
 bos_commonground_desc: "The Tribes of Umbra, far to the north, remain some of the last independent people in all of California. Yet even now, the NCR moves to civilize or evict these people. For the sake of sequering expansions in the north, they should be brought into our sphere of influence."

 bos_union: "Camaraderie Union"
 bos_union_desc: "The Chosen One, who rules Arroyo, once saved the wasteland with our aid. As such, we have remained on good terms with them and their people ever since. Mayhaps it is time to call upon such good graces, and bring them into the fold? An buffer state to the chaos in the north, and a limiter to the NCR's relentless expansionism."

 bos_seize: "Seize Arroyo"
 bos_seize_desc: "Why use words when force will do? The people of Arroyo are weak by far, and while we could bring them into an alliance, we would do far better by simply taking their resources and equipment as our own. They could do little to stop us, if we decided to march upon them."

 bos_homefront: "Trouble on the Homefront"
 bos_homefront_desc: "Tensions with the Shi have never been particularly good, but what can one expect when two technological powerhouses live so closely to one another? It is only by our good graces that they retain control over their own advanced weaponry and technology, although recent events now threaten this mutual understanding."

 bos_scrapsilicon: "Scrap Silicon Valley"
 bos_scrapsilicon_desc: "Silicon Valley has been explored by Brotherhood scouts and scribes for decades, in the hopes of finding new and rare technology. However, in recent years it has become overwhelmingly apparent that what the Brotherhood needs may simple be resources. Do we change the objective of the most recent expedition?"

 bos_exploresilicon: "Explore Silicon Valley"
 bos_exploresilicon_desc: "Despite our need for raw resources, such as metal, the Brotherhood of Steel shall stay true to its core function, the recovery of ancient relics and technological caches. The most recent expedition to the Silicon valley shall maintain its current goals."

 bos_strip: "Strip the Sub"
 bos_strip_desc: "The hollowed out remains of the Sub that brought the Shi to America have been resting in the harbor for decades now, a source of high quality, but hard to reach military grade steel and metal. The recovery and scrapping of this vessel could lead to a reasonable cache of resources."

 bos_slums: "Develop the Slums"
 bos_slums_desc: "The people of the Bay Area have long suffered from what one would expect. A lack of clean water, dedicated crime, and shoddy housing. Taking the time to render aid to these people could ensure long term loyalty to the Brotherhood, and give us just cause to place a series of high quality water filters in the area."

 bos_destroy: "Destroy Hubology"
 bos_destroy_desc: "The Hubologists have been wasting technology for decades now. Suicidal rocket experiments, attempts to civilize robots, and other innumerable inane projects that have only ended in disaster. They have squandered an incalculable amount of technology in their insane pursuit, but no more!"

 bos_civillians: "Encourage Civilian Business"
 bos_civillians_desc: "The people of the Bay are often fearful when it comes to opening storefronts or attempting to form anything resembling a business, because such things are often prime targets for raiders and gangs. However, with the promise of Brotherhood protection, we could usher in a new generation of Civilians loyal to the Brotherhood of Steel."

 bos_curbstomp: "Curb Raider Aggression"
 bos_curbstomp_desc: "The Raiders of the Bay Area have been a thorn in the side of the Brotherhood of Steel's operations for decades now, between harassing our patrols and smuggling out rare resources and equipment before we can get our hands on them, it has become apparent that they are something we need to deal with."

 bos_expand: "Expand Private Industry"
 bos_expand_desc: "Part of ensuring the safety of any given area is making sure that people are well armed and capable of protecting themselves when our patrols are not present. As such, developing the private arms industry in the bay area is necessary for our continued PR attempts."

 bos_steelrain: "Steel Rain"
 bos_steelrain_desc: "For too long have we struggled with and against the Shi. Their technocratic ways and willingness to tolerate crime in our area of influence have made it clear to man within the hierarchy of the Brotherhood that they are opposed to our goals, and as such, must be brought to heel."

 bos_shichapter: "Establish the Shi Chapter"
 bos_shichapter_desc: "The Shi could easily be conquered by our forces, but many within the brotherhood fear that such a choice of action would lead to the mass destruction of their secretive technological archives. Instead, an alternative method has been proposed... why not simply invite them to join us?"

 bos_demand: "Demand the Bay"
 bos_demand_desc: "Our recent show of force against the Shi has shaken the mighty NCR. We could make use of this moment and attempt to demand the NCR owned section of the Bay Area, Point-Green."

 bos_emperor: "Audience with the Emperor"
 bos_emperor_desc: "The Emperor of the Shi has deemed us worth of a formal meeting, following the founding of our chapter. He is a marvelous machine, and while many are uncomfortable with the presence of this AI, many more are eager to hear the secrets he could teach us."

 bos_shisecrets: "Stolen Secrets"
 bos_shisecrets_desc: "The ground infantry of the Shi bring with them advance Gauss Weaponry, the likes of which can't be produced anywhere else in the wasteland. By controlling their areas of manufacturing, we can take such weapons from their producers."

 bos_shiseize: "Seize the Military"
 bos_shiseize_desc: "What remains of the Shi Military has surrendered, but could still have a purpose within the Brotherhood. Although they are resentful, many of them were merely conscripted by the Shi, and should be manageable with the transition to new leadership."

 bos_gauss: "Gauss Weapons"
 bos_gauss_desc: "The secrets of Gauss have been gifted to us by the Emperor himself, his cherished weapons offered as a symbol of friendship and continued alliance. Maybe he's worried we'd betray him if he didn't attempt to placate us? Either way, our gain."

 bos_vertibirds: "Vertibird Schematics"
 bos_vertibirds_desc: "The Vertibird Schematics stolen from the Enclave many years ago have been a long coveted secret of the Shi, who haven't entirely managed to master the air of their manufacturing. Howevering, by combining our knowledge, we shall surely gain understanding that rivals even that of the former Enclave."

 # Mojave Veterans sub-tree

 bos_mojavevets: "Mojave Veterans"
 bos_mojavevets_desc: "The men and women of the Mojave Chapter are among our most distant relatives, due in no small part to a lack of communication and understanding. That being said, even they are willing to answer the calling, sending volunteers when the Brotherhood calls."

 bos_mojavesignal: "The Mojave Signal"
 bos_mojavesignal_desc: "For the longest time, the primary issue barring us from active communication with our Brothers in the Mojave has been their fault communication equipment, which is largely incapable of long distance signaling. The delivery of some of our own equipment to them should help to ease this burden."

 bos_genius: "Elijah's Genius"
 bos_genius_desc: "Elder Elijah is a controversial figure on the best of days, due to his overt interest in the persuit of wonder weapons and technological miriacles that he feels can save the wasteland. He is the embodiment of our ideals in their most extreme, and is willing to throw away anything for technology."

 bos_hardin: "Hardin's Tactics"
 bos_hardin_desc: "Head Paladin Hardin is the man that the vast majority of Elders now wish had been elected to take over the Mojave Chapter, if only because many suspect that the genius of Elijah has been wasted. Hardin is the man's man, a Paladin who honors the tactics and ideals of the Brotherhood, while also understanding the necessity of political flexibility."

 bos_foodforservice: "Food for Service"
 bos_foodforservice_desc: "The Mojave Brotherhood have had been hoarding ancient pieces of technology and data that could drastically improve the quality of life for farmers in rougher areas. Requesting these could give us leverage when it comes to conscription."

 bos_drills: "Boxing Drills"
 bos_drills_desc: "Hardin is classical in more ways than one, and his insistence on basic hand to hand training for all soldiers is considered to be subtle genius in the eyes of many elders. Instilling the habit of sporting combat in our warriors makes them more capable of taking and recovering blows, and more likely to maintain fitness without prodding."

 bos_software: "Study Securitron Software"
 bos_software_desc: "Elijah has spent decades working on reverse engineering the works of Doctor House, not the least of which has involved taking apart and analyzing what it is that makes Securitrons more capable than the average robot. "

 bos_mojaveequip: "Mojave Equipment"
 bos_mojaveequip_desc: "The Mojave Brotherhood of Steel works in what might be the most inhospitable heat imaginable, and have developed a number of specialized weapon maintenance routines to keep their weapons in working order."

 bos_hardware: "Study Securitron Hardware"
 bos_hardware_desc: "Years of taking Securitrons apart has given Elijah a deep insight into many of a secrets and techniques used by Robco to outdo their rivals. As the Securitrons were among the most advanced robots ever created by Pre War America."

 bos_logisticaltech: "Logistical Technology"
 bos_logisticaltech_desc: "Due in part to their deep tendency to resort to deep reconnaissance behind enemy lines, the men and women under Hardin’s command can easily teach us how to do more with less. Supplies are everything to a soldier in the field."

 bos_plantations: "Industrial Plantations"
 bos_plantations_desc: "Elijah has requested that we provide him with the fixings necessary to expand his own industry and general logistical capacity. Providing him with such will continue to earn this wildcard’s loyalty."

 bos_foundry: "Laser Foundry"
 bos_foundry_desc: "Hardin has asked what we expected of him, the means of producing weapons so that he might better protect the interests of his chapter, and thus the Brotherhood at large."

 bos_plant: "Sarsaparilla Plant"
 bos_plant_desc: "An expeditionary team has been sent to the Sunset Sarsaparilla plant in the Mojave with the intent of recovering a series of rare technological caches and half functional robots that could be repaired and repurposed for war."

 bos_militia: "Organised Militia"
 bos_militia_desc: "Hardin is more willing that most members of the Brotherhood to resort to taking outside help, and getting involved in outside conflicts. To this end, we find that he has garnered the attention and adoration of a number of smaller militia groups, some of whom he is willing to send to us."

 bos_recallelder: "Elder Recalled"
 bos_recallelder_desc: "The Mojave Chapter has operated as a Semi-Independent entity for far too long now, recalling their Elder to meet with the council should hopefully remind them who it is they server, and bring them back into the fold of our overall goals."

 bos_repconn: "REPCONN HQ"
 bos_repconn_desc: "It is time to launch our own technological expeditions into the Mojave, and many believe that we should begin with the REPCONN HQ, which is thought to be both a Cache of resources and technology in the heart of the Mojave."


 # Blueprint Recovery sub-tree

 
 bos_blueprints: "Blueprint Recovery."
 bos_blueprints_desc: "We have gathered, over the last few hundred years, innumerable computers with hidden information. While we have stockpiled them endlessly, often we have not bothered to extract their secrets. How many blueprints and schematics have we ignored?"
 
 bos_viperlogs: "Viper Combat Logs."
 bos_viperlogs_desc: "The first true conflict we ever engaged in was our Viper Conflict, which took the life of Elder Maxson and in many ways, introduced us to the horrifying zeal of some wasteland factions. To this day, we analyze these conflicts again and again, so that we might never forget these lessons."

 bos_scribemaintenance: "Scribe Maintenance Routines."
 bos_scribemaintenance_desc: "The Duty of a scribe is a sacred thing, for a scribe must constantly work to improve their knowledge of machines and technology, all the while striving to improve upon and master their construction and maintenance. "

 bos_mutantramblings: "Mutant Ramblings."
 bos_mutantramblings_desc: "Despite what one might think, the vast majority of Mutants are hardcoded warriors with an innate understanding of military tactics and doctrine. Analysis of their ramblings and recordings has delivered us with valuable tactical data in the past."

 bos_armmaxson: "Arm Maxson."
 bos_armmaxson_desc: "The state of Maxson is where we draw the vast majority of our lesser conscripts, who are unworthy of our more advanced equipment. That being said, developing our ability to arm them in ways comparable or superior to the NCR is a necessary element of our self-defense."

 bos_reactionchambers: "Laser Focus Foundry."
 bos_reactionchambers_desc: "The focusing crystals in a given laser rifle are incredibly hard to recreate, and up until this point in time, impossible to mass produce. Thankfully, that has changed, following the recovery in essential blueprints."

 bos_navarrotacticaldata: "Navarro Tactical Data."
 bos_navarrotacticaldata_desc: "The tactical information gained from the War with the Enclave give the Brotherhood of Steel something it had never before had to deal with. Battle with a technologically superior foe. Teaching our soldiers to be more reliant on their combat abilities, instead of depending on superior technology."

 bos_supplymaxson: "Supply Maxson."
 bos_supplymaxson_desc: "The men and women of Maxson are our first line against invasion, the shield that allows the hammer of the Brotherhood of Steel to fall upon a foe. Supplying them with firearms and the ability to make their own is an essential piece of defensive stratagem."

 bos_simplified: "Simplified Designs."
 bos_simplified_desc: "The Common Laser Rifle has been the reliable companion to the Brotherhood of Steel for many generations. While many within the organization are pushing towards newer weapons, the older weapons are more than sufficient when it comes to dealing with any foe. "

 bos_oldworld: "Old World Focuses."
 bos_oldworld_desc: "The Advanced Energy Weapons that we are currently prototyping are both incredibly effective and incredibly hard to make. Looking towards the future will be essential if we ever want to make use of them, which means gearing our equipment towards their production now."

 bos_superioralloys: "Superior Alloys."
 bos_superioralloys_desc: "The Metallic Alloys used in the creation of power armor are hard to come by, and harder still to recreate. While we have managed to perfect this art to a degree, it remains limited to older, somewhat inferior suits of armor."

 bos_scraprefinement: "Scrap Refinement."
 bos_scraprefinement_desc: "Our ability to find and repair more advanced pieces of power armor is becoming more important with each passing day. Gearing and training more of our scribes to work on these projects will vastly increase our ability to later sustain their production."

 bos_surge: "Surge Research."
 bos_surge_desc: "Tesla Weaponry has been a long coveted and studied without our most secretive labs. Recent innovations have finally made the secrets of long-hidden magnetic coil management known to us. Soon, we shall be able to roll these weapons out!"

 bos_powermanage: "Power Management."
 bos_powermanage_desc: "Sentry Bots are, without a doubt, the pinnacle of robotic engineering, and something that the Brotherhood has long coveted the construction of. Even as we prepared to study and produce these machines, we are finding ways to incorporate experimental power cores into their design, for greater weapon effectiveness."

 bos_alloyconstruction: "Alloy Construction."
 bos_alloyconstruction_desc: "Sentry Bots are, without a doubt, the pinnacle of robotic engineering, and something that the Brotherhood has long coveted the construction of. Even as we prepared to study and produce these machines, we are finding ways to incorporate experimental alloys into their design, for greater armor effectiveness."




 # Securing Equipment sub-tree

 bos_secureequipment: "Secure Equipment"

 bos_developmaxson: "Develop Maxson"
 bos_developmaxson_desc: "What money we do put into the development of Maxson is invariably put into defensive outposts and locations. These help keep raiders at bay, and help to remind the NCR that it is our banners that fly here."

 bos_navarrooutpost: "Navarro Outpost Protocol"
 bos_navarrooutpost_desc: "Navarro is a fortress onto itself, but the surrounding area is largely lacking in any form of viable defensive position. Investing in fortifications in these key locations will help us to maintain our northern security."

 bos_welcomingcommittee: "Welcoming Committee"
 bos_welcomingcommittee_desc: "Our newest allies shall soon receive our welcoming committee, which consists of no small number of veteran Paladins, sent to train them in the use of our technology and protect their holdings."

 bos_bayarea: "Bay Area Reconstruction"
 bos_bayarea_desc: "The San Francisco Bay area houses an impossibly vast number of people and a nearly endless supply of technological caches and mundane resources. Investing in this area will bring us closer to these goods, and more so, bring the people closer to sharing them with us."

 bos_refurbishment: "Lost Hills Refurbishment Plan"
 bos_refurbishment_desc: "Despite what one might think, many of our older bunkers are in desperate need of repair. Even the Lost Hills, the seat of our power, experiences near regular blackouts and has issues with filtration systems. Simple repair efforts will help us prepare for an ambitious expansion scheme, meant to turn the bunker into a true underground complex."

 bos_maxsonoutpost: "Maxson Outpost"
 bos_maxsonoutpost_desc: "Further Fortifications in Maxson have come not because the elders have suggested them, but because the locals have demanded them. Enthusiasm is at an all-time high, and no raiders dare strike against those who stand under our banner."

 bos_rangerpaladins: "Ranger Paladins"
 bos_rangerpaladins_desc: "The Rangers have joined our just cause! They are not truly members of the Brotherhood of Steel until they are clad in our armor. We are sending scribes to share these precious secrets with our newest allies. Let us hope they use them well."

 bos_recreatemilits: "Recreate Military Industry"
 bos_recreatemilits_desc: "The Bay Area was once the heart of America's military-industrial complex on the western coast. While much of it lies in ruins, the framework is there to revitalize and rearm numerous arms factories."

 bos_industrialcore: "Industrial Core"
 bos_industrialcore_desc: "The storehouses and foundries within the lost hills bunker are among the best of their kind, and a further expansion of the facilities that house them is the key to developing a new Industrial Core."

 bos_maxsonrecruitment: "Maxson Recruitment Drive"
 bos_maxsonrecruitment_desc: "The Men and Women of Maxson are happy to stand under our banner, but one must ask the important question. How many would happily serve under it?"

 bos_navarrohangars: "Navarro Hangar Expansion"
 bos_navarrohangars_desc: "The Hangers of Navarro have been in shambles ever since we destroyed them during the Enclave War. Our efforts to reconstruct them have long been underfunded and lacking in enthusiasm, but as we turn our gaze northwards in search of better expansion, we may yet again find the will to work."

 bos_generatordesign: "Generator Redesign"
 bos_generatordesign_desc: "San Rafael has a large series of military-grade nuclear generators, cooled by endlessly flowing seawater, that have been dormant for decades. Rewiring these machines and connecting them with our facilities would give us an ample supply of energy."

 bos_brotherhoodarms: "Brotherhood Sponsored Arms"
 bos_brotherhoodarms_desc: "We have things that the Rangers lack and they have things that we lack. A simple trade of weapons for men would drastically improve both factions."

 bos_heartland: "Industrial Heartland"
 bos_heartland_desc: "As weapons continue to flow from the Bay Area, the need to improve roads and infrastructure is again made paramount to the Elders, for the crumbling roads are proving to be burdensome even after recent efforts to reinforce them were undertaken."

 bos_defense: "Lost Hills Defense Initiative"
 bos_defense_desc: "While lost hills is a capable and defensible bunker, it is, unfortunately, ineffective as a defensive line. One can remain safe in the hole for years, but defending the area about will require outposts and patrols in a far greater number than we currently encourage."

 bos_dockyards: "Dockyard Expansion"
 bos_dockyards_desc: "The coast of California is littered with ancient ports and dockyards that have long been little more than scavenging locations. If are are to contest the NCR at sea, we shall need to put greater effort into our efforts to revitalize these locations."

 bos_navarrofacilities: "Navarro Facilities Expansion"
 bos_navarrofacilities_desc: "Numerous armories and repair stations remain in Navarro, but many are unmanned and in a state of ill repair. These places would be ideal for training a new generation of scribes in the production of more advanced equipment."

 bos_renovatearms: "Renovate Arms Factories"
 bos_renovatearms_desc: "Our efforts to establish the militant heartland of California's old industry have gone well, but further effort could still be applied to gain greater effectiveness in these places."

 bos_losthillsexpansion: "Lost Hills Expansion"
 bos_losthillsexpansion_desc: "The effort to expand the subterranean complex of the Lost Hills Bunker have gone off supremely, and even now, more effort is being channeled towards upgrading our other bunkers! Let it not be said that we are vulnerable to outside attack."

 bos_vandenberg: "Vandenberg Expedition"
 bos_vandenberg_desc: "Another day? Another ambitious young paladin with the dream of an expedition to a secretive pre-war facility. Vandenberg has long been a coveted prize, and one that is relatively close to home."

 bos_hammer: "The Hammer"
 bos_hammer_desc: "The Desert Rangers employ a training regime that focuses heavily on ridged, old world tactics, not unlike our warriors. However, they often make use of unnecessary drills and tactics that have no value in the post-nuclear world. We should help them trim these wasteful practices."

 bos_westforge: "Forge the West"
 bos_westforge_desc: "The Bay Area is flourishing following our investments! Strong roads and a potent weapons industry have brought traders from across California to buy and barter within our controlled locations."

 bos_hangarconstruction: "Hangar Construction"
 bos_hangarconstruction_desc: "The Lost Hills Bunker never possessed any effective Hanger Bay, and as such could not launch smaller craft. The most recent answer, although expensive, is a simple remedy. The construction of an above ground landing strip and a hanger bay. "

 bos_secrets: "Navarro's Secrets"
 bos_secrets_desc: "The information we gained from Navarro was so heavily encrypted that it was only recently that we gained any meaningful breakthroughs with it. It fights us every step of the way, but we are slowly unraveling the Enclave’s secrets."

 bos_anvil: "The Anvil"
 bos_anvil_desc: "The offensive doctrine of the largely reactionary Desert Rangers lacks in many ways. They detest shock tactics and don’t incorporate advanced technology into their ground assaults. We must remind them that power armor is designed around these tactical actions and that they shall have to adapt."

 bos_steelfortress: "Fortress of Steel"
 bos_steelfortress_desc: "Between radio towers and further above ground fortifications, it can be said that the Lost Hills Bunker is a near impenetrable fortress, ringed with flags that bear the symbol of steel."

 bos_steel: "The Steel"

 bos_scribelexicon:0 "Scribe Lexicon"
 bos_scribelexicon_desc:0 "The Desert Rangers are, generally speaking, lacking in advanced weapons despite possessing the ability to produce them. A simple exchange of blueprints should allow us to catch them up."
 
 bos_powerarmourdevelop: "Power Armor Development"
 bos_powerarmourdevelop_desc: "An industry geared to produce something as complex and resource intensive as power armor can be easily regeared to do almost anything else."

 bos_zeppelinfoundry: "Zeppelin Foundry"
 bos_zeppelinfoundry_desc: "Long Ago, a vast fleet of Zeppelins were used to stage a massive expedition to the east. Now, decades later, we again find ourselves in need of such airships, and find ourselves making moves to repair the foundries of old.."

 bos_maxsongifts: "Maxson's Gifts"
 bos_maxsongifts_desc: "Who needs new technology when we have reliable and maintainable equipment already? Maxon’s gifts are more than enough for us, and we do not need to replace them anytime soon."

 bos_forbiddensecrets: "Forbidden Secrets"
 bos_forbiddensecrets_desc: "The Power Armor of the Enclave was thought to be irreplicable by many of our most senior scribes, yet the steady work of our most skilled technicians has shown us that one needs not worry about replication when you have the core schematics on hand."

 bos_forbiddenweapons: "Forbidden Weapons"
 bos_forbiddenweapons_desc: "The production of Plasma Weaponry, the long-standing hallmark of the most advanced factions in the wasteland, was once thought impossible. With the aid of information stolen from the Enclave, we believe our facilities can be retrofitted to produce them on mass!"

 des_prisons_desc: "The Prison was the original base of operations for the Desert Rangers, and when found, contained a vast number of criminals and scum.

 des_mojave:0 "Peacekeepers Of Nevada"
 des_mojave_desc:0 "The people of Nevada are forever in debt to the Rangers, and often shower them in what supplies they can spare.

 des_jackals: "The Jackals"

 des_vipers:0 "The Vipers"
 des_vipers_desc:0 "The Vipers are snakes in the worst sense of the word. They lied, cheated, and betrayed to get where they are in this world. We would be wise to view them as a serious threat going forward, and wiser still to not underestimate their ability to backstab us."

To this end, a new core of powerarmored warriors is being formed and outfitted."

 ncr_hardline_desc:0 "The bear has been awoken, and now she comes. Let there be retribution for the fallen, the enslaved, and those too weak to stand up for themselves.

Caesar, we come for you, not only because we will it, but because we must."
 
 ncr_integration:0 "The Baja Integration Act"
 ncr_integration_desc:0 "The political masterpiece of Grant C. Hayes is the Baja integration act, the formal creation of an offical NCR state under a reformed bandito council. All parties are willing to sign, although the terms of rejection are incredibly simply, and it would require only a minor offense too send all of this to ruin. Yet who would benifit from that though?"
 
 ncr_mayorvictory:0 "Mayoral Victory Speech"
 ncr_mayorvictory_desc:0 "The Victory Speech of one Grant C. Hayes was broadcast over the radio to all of the NCR this morning. In his thirty minute speech, Grant outlined his plans for the city and the NCR at large.

 ncr_scavunion:0 "Scavengers Union"
 ncr_scavunion_desc:0 "The Scavengers of Dayglow have been the heart of the economy for as long as anyone can remember, and as a reaction to the growth of other industries in the area, they have formed an impromptu union. This has proved to be both beneficial to them and the economy, as a surplus of metal has been made available."
 
 ncr_migration:0 "Baja Migration"
 ncr_migration_desc:0 "With prosperity comes growth, and with growth comes new faces. Thousands of men and women are attempting to immigrate to dayglow from the poverty striken Baja. While they are accepted, there are legitimate fears that this influx could damage the economy and our efficency in the short term."
 
 ncr_supermutants:0 "Super-Mutant Migration"
 ncr_supermutants_desc:0 "Super-Mutants have rights in the NCR, but are rarely welcome. Hayes has advertised Baja as a place where mutants can find freedom and wealth, and good employ. Unfortunately, this message was recieved in ways he hadn't expected, as hundreds of mutants have now moved into the city? What does one do with so many brutes?"
 
 ncr_thirteen:0 "Rebuilding the 13"
 ncr_thirteen_desc:0 "The 13 are a name synonomous with pre-war military dockyards, once used by the US Navy to launch numerous assaults on mainland China. Today, it is a ruin of what it once was, picked clean by scavengers, its dockyards lay empty, and its ships rest at the bottom of the harbor. Revitalization of this strategic outpost would be ideal."

 ncr_pitch:0 "The New Pitch"
 ncr_pitch_desc:0 "Grant C. Hayes has had a small obssession with baseball since he played it while growing up in rural Baja. He believes that it could be a viable icon around which to rally while rebuilding the city, and has personally put his own wealth towards the revitalization of an old stadium in the heart of the city."
 
 ncr_newleague:0 "The League"
 ncr_newleague_desc:0 "Although gathering support has been a challenge, Hayes has begun the process of founding his baseball league. This primarily involves getting wealth individuals or cties throughout the NCR to sponsor and train their own teams, which they can put towards the fledgling propoganda machine."
 
 ncr_leagueradio:0 "Baseball on the Radio"
 ncr_leagueradio_desc:0 "The NCR is one of the few nations with a fully functional radio system, which broadcasts important information across the waves.

 ncr_firstseason:0 "Season One"
 ncr_firstseason_desc:0 "The First Season of Baseball in California has been an amazing success, with thousands tuning in to listen too and enjoy the games, and heroes being made. Yet one team as risen to absolute fame and glory, the first champions of the first league. Who are they?"
 
 ncr_calileague:0 "The Californian League"
 ncr_calileague_desc:0 "Now that baseball is back in the eyes of the people of the NCR, the league is founded, and many citizens rally behind it. Stadiums are being built, teams and lesser leagues founded, a little bit of America has returned to the wasteland at last."
 
 ncr_boneyard:0 "The Boneyard"
 ncr_boneyard_desc:0 "The city of Los Angeles must have been the largest in the world before the War. The L.A. Boneyard stretched forever, the skeletons of buildings lying under the hot sun. Not even the wind entered this dead city. Or so it was for a time, yet now LA grows, people and ghouls return to it and with each passing year, it becomes a little less empty and a little more alive."
 
 ncr_oldcity:0 "Scouring the Old City"
 ncr_oldcity_desc:0 "The Boneyard was once the greatest cities in all of old America, vast in population and size, and filled to the brim with technology and wonders now lost to time. Yet in the ruins, one can still find wonderful things... what has been uncovered recently?"
 
 ncr_bearport:0 "The Bearport"
 ncr_bearport_desc:0 "The NCR has been behind on technological innovation for decades, instead relying heavily on its superiority on land. However, in the boneyard a vast and mostly intact airport has lain dormant for over a century. A new grant for the renewal of this location has been approved by the congress."

 ncr_followers_desc:0 "The Followers of the Apocalypse have always done well by the NCR, and it's time that the favor was returned! Volunteers and doctors are being sent to this organization by the dozen, and offical funding from the regional boneyard promises to grow their organization so that it might better help the people of the NCR."
 
 ncr_bearforceexpansion:0 "Expanding the Bear Force"
 ncr_bearforceexpansion_desc:0 "The aptly named Bear Force of the NCR is, among other things, underfunded and lacking in expertise. However, expansion is still something that is being invested in by the NCR, and a reallocation of funding, as well as guidance from a number of pre-war ghouls, should hopefully expand the NCR's capacity to wage war in the skies."
 
 ncr_flyingbears:0 "When Bears Fly"
 ncr_flyingbears_desc:0 "Despite all odds, the Boneyard's airport has become the Gem of the NCR's airforce, and has become a hub for the refurbishing and reconstruction of assorted aircraft. It is here that aspiring engineers are trained to rebuild the warmachines of old, and it is from here that the NCR's new airfleet shall launch."
 
 ncr_boneyardsprawl:0 "The Boneyard Sprawl"
 ncr_boneyardsprawl_desc:0 "In what was once called Lakewood, lies Adytum, one of the most important settlements in the Boneyard. Lakewood used to be in-land before the war, but the nuclear devastation wrought upon the city caused flooding and destruction of the coastline."
 
 ncr_newcity:0 "Strengthening the New City"
 ncr_newcity_desc:0 "The Boneyard is less a single entity, and more a series of smaller communities that have slowly grown into a rough metropolitian area. As the smaller communities begin to blend together, a new entity, known only as the New City, has begun to emerge."
 
 ncr_dayglowroads:0 "Roads to Dayglow"
 ncr_dayglowroads_desc:0 "Once, the lands between the Boneyard and Dayglow were a maze of roads and highways, an intricate system that allowed for near ideal trade conditions and travel. Now? They are ruins, filled with uncountable wrecks of vehicles, with almost all old world routes choked to the point of uselessness. The clearance of even one of these lands would do wonders for our infastructure."
 
 ncr_mint:0 "The Republic Reserve"
 ncr_mint_desc:0 "The stockpile of all gold and wealth in the NCR is located in the boneyard, and the current Treasurer of the Republic and head of the Republic Reserve is John Michael Henderton; whose signature can be found on the front face of all NCR notes."
 
 ncr_scavfund:0 "Funding Scavengers"
 ncr_scavfund_desc:0 "Scavengers have and continue to be the heart of the boneyard's economy, a small army of men and women who go forth into the ruins of the old world and return with metal and other useful resources. The continued operation of these groups, and their expansion, is key to our economic plan."
 
 ncr_grinvestments:0 "Gun Runner Investments"
 ncr_grinvestments_desc:0 "The Gun Runners of the Boneyard are among the best weaponsmiths in all of the world, and certainly they are the most powerful and successful within the NCR.

 ncr_grexpansion:0 "Gun Runner Expansion"
 ncr_grexpansion_desc:0 "The Gun Runner Expansion is a generous nation from the NCR's military budget, intended to be put towards a large scale expansion of the Gun Runners facilities, so that they might better arm the NCR troops as the push towards standardization is made."
 
 ncr_allisgoodboneyard:0 "All is good in the Boneyard"
 ncr_allisgoodboneyard_desc:0 "Under the leadership of Allgood Murphy, the Boneyard has flourished in ways that were perviously unthinkable. It has become a beacon of progress within the NCR, and to a lesser extent, the wasteland on the whole."
 
 ncr_barons:0 "Barons of the NCR"
 ncr_barons_desc:0 "The NCR's economy is vast and powerful, but there are growing concerns about the assorted Barons and their monopolies on various aspects of the economy. From Brahmin to water, all precious resources are controlled by only a handful of men. Yet when these men work together, their political and economy sway can make miracles happen in unlikely places."
 
 ncr_sac:0 "Sac City Reborn"
 ncr_sac_desc:0 "Sac-Town was once the former capital of California before the bombs fell, and not long after that, it became a bastion for raiders and tribals, notably the 80's. However, town was never a proper term for such a place, and the NCR has made strives to establish the location as an economic hub, their northernmost city of importance."
 
 ncr_hub:0 "The Hub Prospers"
 ncr_hub_desc:0 "The Hub is an enormous trading center and settlement established in an old town relatively untouched by the Great War. Caravans are organized here, carrying goods north to Shady Sands, Junktown, the Mojave Wasteland, and south to the Boneyard."
 
 ncr_junktown:0 "Junktown Florishes"
 ncr_junktown_desc:0 "Junktown is one of the smaller towns in southern California. It was founded shortly after the War by a soldier named Darkwater.[1] Instead of building on the ruins of an old town, he thought it would be better to begin from the ground up. Since becoming a state of the NCR, Junktown has gained notably economic prosperity and growth, due in part to it being the hub of what little trade the NCR has with the BoS."
 
 ncr_80sgarage:0 "The 80's Garages"
 ncr_80sgarage_desc:0 "The 80's Tribe were once among the most powerful raider gangs in all of california, ritual preservationists who maintained their motorbikes with superstitious attention and care. However, the 80's were little match for the NCR military that later pushed them out from their homelands, and to this day, their numerous garages and temples lay mostly untouched, as do the secrets contained within them."
 
 ncr_baroninvest:0 "Baron Investment Opportunities"
 ncr_baroninvest_desc:0 "The economic power of the Baron's can't be understated, and while they often feud, when their minds are put to a task, they can accomplish almost anything within reason. Be it the forced takeover of criminal assets, the corruption of the local police force, or a simple aggressive acquisition of all local competitors."
 
 ncr_longroadhome:0 "The Long Road Home"
 ncr_longroadhome_desc:0 "Roads are the heart of any successful trade route, and for the longest time Sac City has lacked a singular, reliable route to its outlying settlements and to the capital itself. This is easy to remedy, and shall be remedied, it only requires a handful of bribes and an absolutely legitimate aquisition of bulk concrete from Reno."
 
 ncr_crimsoncaravan:0 "Crimson Caravan HQ"
 ncr_crimsoncaravan_desc:0 "Crimson Caravan is the largest caravan outfit in New California, and quite probably the entire Wasteland. The Crimson Caravan Company is the one of the largest supplies of the NCR's military-grade weaponry, and an assortment of provisions and other equipment types. As they flourish, the entire economy is uplifted, so is it not best to give them a helping hand?"
 
 ncr_hubcrime:0 "Crime in the Hub"
 ncr_hubcrime_desc:0 "The crime in the hub has been a concern for decades, with NCR officials often trying to crack down on it and bring it to an end. It holds up the economy in many ways, yet the Baron's understand better than most that in many ways, it is the heart of the Hub's economy. Weapons, drugs, and all sorts of illegal activities keep the hub competitive. What they decide to do with it will change much about the city."
 
 ncr_richroad:0 "The Rich Roads"
 ncr_richroad_desc:0 "As ever, the heart of the NCR is shady sands, and the establishment of a system of roads connecting any township too it will bring in both wealth and prosperity. To this end, the Barons seek to improve upon and perfect the trade routes that currently connect the Hub to the capital, so that their investments might flourish."
 
 ncr_gizmo:0 "Gizmo's Legacy"
 ncr_gizmo_desc:0 "Gizmo was once the most powerful man in all of Junktown, a vile criminal who unintentionally propped the fledgling township up for greatness with his activities and dastardly buisness practices. Although reviled by many of Junktown's citizens, the Brahmin Baron's look favorably upon Gizmo's legacy, and continue to engage in many of the practices that made him powerful and wealthy."
 
 ncr_doctormorbid:0 "Doctor Morbid's School of Medicine"
 ncr_doctormorbid_desc:0 "Doctor Morbid's School of Medicine is the legacy of the somewhat infamous Doctor Morbid, a morally questionally practitioner of medicine who made use of his monopoly on the medical trade to charge outragious prices and fund his numerous other projects, among them the institution."
 
 ncr_newwall:0 "The New Wall"
 ncr_newwall_desc:0 "Junktown has always had an iconic asthetic, a budding city ringed with numerous walls made from ancient vehicles and wrecks. Every few decades, another layer is added to contain the ever expanding population, and it is time that the newest outer sprawl be brought within the confines of this layered defense."
 
 ncr_bearsroar:0 "The Bear Roars"
 ncr_bearsroar_desc:0 "The NCR's military is the strongest in all of the wasteland, tens of thousands of men and women who are both well equiped and reasonably drilled. These men and women are backed up by a dedicated and capable logistics core, the supreme talent and skill of the Rangers, and an undeniable dedication too civilization in the wasteland. When the Bear Roars, the wasteland trembles."
 
 ncr_standardarms:0 "Weapon Standardization"
 ncr_standardarms_desc:0 "The NCR has been having certain issues with equipping its infantry, not due to a lack of firearms, but due to an overwhelming variety. Numerous small manufacturers produce innumerable weapons for the NCR, some of which take different ammunition or break after brief amounts of use. This inconsistency has caused hell for our forces in the field."
 
 ncr_grdeals:0 "Gun Runner Deal "
 ncr_grdeals_desc:0 "The group most suited to aiding in the standardization of the NCR's military equipment would have to be the gun runners, who pride overt quality and standards above any other group in the wasteland. By paying the Gun Runners to send experts to oversee weapon manufacturing across the wasteland, we should be able to increase the quality of our weapons in general."
 
 ncr_grliscense:0 "Gun Runner Licensing"
 ncr_grliscense_desc:0 "The Gun Runners have quickly proven themselves as the superior weaponsmiths in the wasteland, and moreso, our recent efforts to fund them have put them into a position where they can sustain a far greater output in a reliable way. Efforts are already being made in congress to make them the sole provider of firearms to the NCR's military core, we need only approve this motion."
 
 ncr_drummund1:0 "Drummand's Army "
 ncr_drummund1_desc:0 "Alexander Drummund is obsessed with the armies of the old world, and has spent much of his long life studying the tactics of the old world. The unification of arms and overeager integration of transport vehicles, artilary and the overwhelming firepower of tanks. Drummund dreams of an NCR military that has the tools to deal with any foe."
 
 ncr_blast:0 "Blast from the Past"
 ncr_blast_desc:0 "The cannon revolutionized warfare, rewriting the playbook time and time again. It seems that the wasteland has forgotten the cannon, for so many nations forgo its usage. However, the NCR is in a unique position to gather and make use of such weapons; something Drummund fully intends to do."
 
 ncr_mobile:0 "Army of Mobility "
 ncr_mobile_desc:0 "The ability to move troops and supplies from place to place is a key feature in any army, and while the NCR has some capacity to do this, it is currently treated as an afterthought to be used in choice situations, rather than as an element of core NCR doctorine. This must be remedied if the NCR is to push forward militarily."
 
 ncr_spear:0 "The Tip of the Spear "
 ncr_spear_desc:0 "Drummund has spent decades collecting information from scattered libraries and military instillations, exploring the usage of the now elusive tank through the ages. Warfare in the wasteland, and the limited volume of tanks has made the vast majority of these tactics invalid, yet it has also given Drummund the insight needed to formulate his own new doctorine of vehicular warfare."
 
 ncr_jim:0 "Big Jim's Army "
 ncr_jim_desc:0 "Big Jim is not a particularly complicated man when it comes to tactic, he values bravery and loyalty in his troops above any particular strategy or methodology. In many ways, this makes Big Jim's army overwhelmingly inflexible, but at the end of the day? The introduction of simple drills once taught to him by the Desert Ranger should allow the NCR's average soldier to rise to new heights."
 
 ncr_drills:0 "Infantry Drills"
 ncr_drills_desc:0 "As odd as it may seem, one of the first things the Big Jim elected to do after being appoint as leader of the NCR's military was to reinevent the wheel when it came to their incredibly rudimentary infantry drills. The integration of simple squad tactics and more complicated marksmanship and urban assault tactics should have a marked improvement on the average soldier in the NCR's Military."
 
 ncr_march:0 "Military March "
 ncr_march_desc:0 "The marching drills of Big Jim have been met with resounding frustration from the average soldier, who loaths the idea of marching for days on end even after one has met the physical requirements. The point of these exersizes is to increase the overall mobility of infantry as a unit, rather than individuals. This standardization of mobility and increased milage on foot soldiers is a general boon."
 
 ncr_draft:0 "The Big Jim Draft"
 ncr_draft_desc:0 "The Big Jim Draft is something few people actually expected to see, as many in the NCR feel that conscription is one of the leading issues in relation to the quality of the NCR's military forces, yet as Jim's Doctorine stresses the importance of overwhelming numbers of high quality infantry, the need to enlist more men and women, willing or otherwise, is a necessity."
 
 ncr_rangergenmossman:0 "Mossman's Army"
 ncr_rangergenmossman_desc:0 "Ranger General Mossman has something of a distain for the average soldier in the NCR, and views them as an awkward, blunt tool, better for pinning an enemy down than actually accomplishing anything in particular. To this end, he believes in the expansion and increased importance of the Rangers, and instead puts much of his funding towards improving them."
 
 ncr_rangercore:0 "The New Ranger Core"
 ncr_rangercore_desc:0 "The increased funding, diverted from that usually given the NCR's common army, has had a notable impact on the Rangers in general. Superior facilities and the Lion's share of able bodied recruits has enabled them too grow in number and quality, with propoganda stating again and again that the Ranger Core has never been stronger."
 
 ncr_rangerlead:0 "Rangers Lead the Way"
 ncr_rangerlead_desc:0 "Rangers are, above all other things, special forces capable of infilitration and reconnaissance. Ranger General Mossman employs a relatively simple approach to large scale engagement, one that involves using rangers to scout ahead of a main body of infantry in order to assess the ideal location for an engagement and to counter any and all moves and enemy might make."
 
 ncr_rangercanopeners:0 "Ranger can-openers"
 ncr_rangercanopeners_desc:0 "Ranger General Mossman, like many within the NCR Rangers, feel that the brotherhood of steel are easily the most dangerous threat that the NCR faces to this date, a thorn in the side of the republic who use their advanced technology to bully the commonfolk of the NCR. To this end, special drills and tactics are being developed by the Rangers, informally referred too as can opener techniques."
 
 ncr_mechcore:0 "Mechanized Core"
 ncr_mechcore_desc:0 "The NCR is one of the few nations in the world capable of sustaining a sizable fleet of support vehicles and motorized support. While these vehicles fill a largely logistical role, on rare occasion one can find these divisions risked on daring envolpment techniques against the NCR's more slippery foes."
 
 ncr_shock:0 "Shock Companies"
 ncr_shock_desc:0 "The introduction of the APC to the NCR's military could be a gamechanger in wars against more powerful foes, such as the Legion or the Brotherhood of Steel. To this end, the mass production of vehicles for so called 'shock battalions' has become a priority for those in the highest echelons of military command."
 
 ncr_rapid:0 "Rapid Advance Doctorine"
 ncr_rapid_desc:0 "The Motorized core of the NCR is in many ways, a separate entity to the army itself. It shares few commanders and has incompatible tactics and strategies when in battle. The improved integration of these forces and a greater unity in tactics could allow the NCR to make better use of this valuable strategic advantage."
 
 new_american_pmc:0 "American PMC"

 new_church_desc:0 "Constructing churches and schools across Reno would go a long way towards our dream of an idealistic town, no longer a city full of the worst scum of the Wasteland. Dismantling some of the old families' casinos for our churches is also a fitting metaphor for our future."

 new_salvatores_desc:0 "One of the smaller families, we Salvatores bore our time, and with great patience and cunning plotted our way into power.

 veg_families:0 "Three Families" 
 veg_families_desc:0 "House hopes to rebuild the world, and to do so he has to start by rebuilding his beloved Vegas.

 veg_newvegas:0 "New Vegas"
 veg_newvegas_desc:0 "The process of rebuilding Vegas didn't happen quickly, and between spending money hunting for his precious platium chip and micromanaging the families of the strip, House has found himself more than occupied.

 veg_oldauthority:0 "Old Authority"
 veg_oldauthority_desc:0 "Long ago? I ruled Vegas with my machines and my wealth. There were none in this city who could stand against me, and now? More than ever? That is true.

 veg_house:0 "The House"
 veg_house_desc:0 "Vegas, or as they are now calling it, New Vegas, has been my home for so long as I can remember.

 veg_nwo:0 "New World Order"
 veg_nwo_desc:0 "The Wasteland is a vile and dangerous place, and the gangs herein are uncouth and violent in the extreme. Those who are not with my plans for peace are against them, and I shall humble them as I did business rivals long ago."

 veg_clean_desc:0 "The raider gangs within the Mojave were not something I had planned on having to deal with, for they were initially too few in number to matter.

 veg_frisco:0 "Reopen the Frisco Mines"
 veg_frisco_desc:0 "The Silvermines in Frisco had always been a personal goal of mine before the war, though I never found the time to get around to opening them, and those who owned the land were unfair with their pricing. But now? There is little that could be done to stop a hostile acquisition."
 
 veg_silver:0 "Silver Business"
 veg_silver_desc:0 "While rare metals aren’t worth what they were before the war, they are still valuable in the extreme. The small but steady income from the Frisco mines is something that helps New Vegas to flourish, and moreso? Something I can expand upon in the future."
 
 veg_architect:0 "Architect of Destiny"
 veg_architect_desc:0 "To say that I planned all of this would be a lie, but to say that I did not take that which I was given and create for myself something new and beautiful would be untrue. I have become the Architect of Destiny, and I shall build for myself a new world."

 veg_foreigninvest:0 "Secure Foreign Investors"

 veg_ncrembassy:0 "NCR Embassy"
 veg_ncrembassy_desc:0 "The New California Republic is a blessing in disguise, easily manipulated, desperate to have Vegas under their control, and with the greatest military this side of the Colorado River.

 veg_ncrdeal:0 "NCR Trade Deal"
 veg_ncrdeal_desc:0 "The New California Republic has offered New Vegas the status of prefered trade Partner, which should allow for preferential treatment during trade negotiations and competitions on both parts.

 veg_newmanagement:0 "New Management"
 veg_newmanagement_desc:0 "Robert House is a relic of the past, a fool who doesn’t understand the wasteland or the lives of the people within it. It’ll take ambitious minds to bring New Vegas under new management, but thankfully there is no shortage of such minds in the city of sin."
 
 veg_king:0 "The King"
 veg_king_desc:0 "The King is the voice and soul of the people of New Vegas, the downtrodden many who lived in the ruins of the place before it became a bastion of civilization once again.

 veg_segregate:0 "Segregate Vegas"
 veg_segregate_desc:0 "As sad is it is to admit, the poor of New Vegas leech wealth from the strip. They come in masses, building debts they can never repay, destabilizing the delicate balancing act that has brought us such wealth!

 veg_revitalize:0 "Revitalise Freeside"

 veg_vault21_desc:0 "The Vault below New Vegas is a source of great pride for the people of New Vegas, yet it could also be a source of great wealth.

 veg_cerulean:0 "Cerulean Robotics"
 veg_cerulean_desc:0 "The Abandoned Cerulean Robotics facility, located just west of Freeside, has been out of operation since the bombs feel.

 veg_followersupport_desc:0 "The Followers of the apocalypse arrived in Vegas before House emerged from his coma, and were working to civilize the city for the betterment of mankind.

 veg_industry:0 "Kickstart Vegas"
 veg_industry_desc:0 "There are dozens of little shops and smaller casinos decorating Vegas, and among them? An insurmountable number of poor and impoverished people.

 veg_muggers:0 "Enlist the Muggers"
 veg_muggers_desc:0 "The Muggers are a particularly violent gang of women, many of whom the elderly widows of raiders who were slain out west, who have gained a reputation for being brutal and effective.
